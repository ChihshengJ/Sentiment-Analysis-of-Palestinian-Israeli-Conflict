# Report Folder Content

The `Report` directory contains two essential documents that outline the progression of the project:

- `proposal.pdf`: The original project proposal which outlines the intended research, methodologies, and objectives planned at the outset of the project. This document served as the initial blueprint for the project's direction.

- `report.pdf`: This is the final project report that provides comprehensive details on the actual work conducted, the results obtained, and the conclusions drawn. It may contain updates, changes, or conflict with the original proposal due to the dynamic nature of the project's development.

Please note that while both documents are valuable for understanding the project's evolution, the `report.pdf` should be considered the definitive source of information as it reflects the final outcomes and incorporates any adjustments made during the course of the project.
