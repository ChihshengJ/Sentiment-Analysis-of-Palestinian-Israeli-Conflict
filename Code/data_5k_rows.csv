Many but not all religions have started wars over their beliefs, and some seem to motivate (or at least be used as justification for) wars and violence at exceptionally higher rates.

France is not a federation of states like the USA, and all laws apply to the full extent to the French territory, unlike the USA where states have a lot of freedom in implementing laws. Also, in the USA there is this idea that the federal state should mind their own business, and a lot of freedom is given to the different states. So, changing the constitution in the USA would cause plenty of headaches as it could make part of the population angry and need to apply the change at each state level, to ensure that local laws follow new rules.

62% of Ukrainians believe that elections should only be held after the war is over, according to a poll published by the International Republican Institute (IRP) on Oct. 24.
  

  
According to the results of the survey, only 22% of respondents prefer to see elections take place as early as March 2024, 6% would like to see elections take place as early as September 2024, and 3% in March 2025, if the war is still ongoing at those times.
  

  
A vast majority of respondents believe that Ukrainian diaspora communities should participate in Ukrainian elections, with 70% of respondents believing it is ""very important"" or ""somewhat important"" that Ukrainians outside the country vote in any upcoming elections, as opposed to 28% of respondents believing that the issue is ""somewhat not important"" or ""not important at all.""
  

  
Under Ukraine's Constitution, elections are prohibited while the country is in a state of martial law.
  

  
In addition to questions posed about upcoming elections, respondents were also asked about Ukrainians' support for being included in NATO.
  

  
79% of Ukrainians would vote in a referendum to join NATO, if one was held, with 5% intending to vote against joining the bloc of nations. The results highlight a 20 percentage point increase since April 2022, when 59% of respondents supported Ukraine joining NATO.
  

  
When asked about respondents' support for Ukrainian government officials, President Zelensky topped the list of support with 82% of respondents indicating they ""approve"" of the work the President is doing, down slightly from 89% in February 2023.
  

  
Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba scored second on the list with 71% of respondents approving his performance, followed by Oleksiy Danilov, secretary of the National Security and Defense Council, with 59% of respondents approving of his performance.
  

  
A random sample of 2,000 Ukrainians respondents was conducted September 9-12 through computer-assisted telephone interviews. The results are deemed accurate within 2.2 percentage points 19 times out of 20.",2023-10-29T22:38:26,Silly-avocatoe,15,Comment,https://kyivindependent.com/poll-62-of-ukrainians-favor-postponing-elections-until-after-war/

Comment,"Yeah, I feel like it would be extremely risky to do this. Considering it looks like the vast majority both support holding off on an election and also still support Zelensky, it's extra not worth the risk. 

Also, according to the article, their constitution doesn't allow for it anyway, so they would have to amend their constitution in order to hold the election.

Russia cannot win a war of attrition and they know that. They're in WW1 against Ottoman Empire phase, lol. At that point it'll take an extremely long time to even go back to a healthy population not inundated with health issues.

Comment,"Honestly I see this ending the same way Russia left WW1. Eventually too many people realize they've lost and they either a) gotta get rid of Putin or b) wont have a Country being able to be rebuilt.

At a certain point the sunken costs into the war will be too much.

A war of attrition will only happen if the U.S stops providing aid. Even then Europe will step up it's game on a widespread scale. But that's what would make the attrition evenish.

But atm Russia can't fire enough artillery shells compared to Ukraine, doesn't have enough drones, and doesn't have air superiority. And has lost a widespread amount of modernized tanks and artillery. 

I also wouldn't call it a stalemate. Mines suck and take time to get around, it's why Ukraine had to adopt from going in Vehicle first to going in with squads with no vehicles which worked well.

I also wouldn't compare last year to this year. Ukraine still has taken nearly twice as more landmass back this year than Russia did during their offensive.

It's more slow, sure. But it's not a stalemate.",2023-10-29T23:03:57,Ithikari,10,Comment,https://kyivindependent.com/poll-62-of-ukrainians-favor-postponing-elections-until-after-war/
Comment,">Honestly I see this ending the same way Russia left WW1.

It took 3 years and catastrophic military defeats (Tannenberg) for Russia to collapse under the horrors of WWI. And that was against a massive front with both the Germans and Austrians marching into their territory.

This conflict is on a much smaller scale, and practically none of it is affecting Russian territory. They can keep this up for a while.",2023-10-30T00:19:48,Eagle4317,1,Comment,https://kyivindependent.com/poll-62-of-ukrainians-favor-postponing-elections-until-after-war/
Comment,"Thanks for going into depth and explaining your reasoning.

On the point of whether it's currently a stalemate.

>I also wouldn't compare last year to this year. Ukraine still has taken nearly twice as more landmass back this year than Russia did during their offensive.

Ukraine has recaptured 370 square kilometres in their offensive this year. That's about 0.3% of the land Russia is occupying. As you point out, mines have been shown to be very effective at stalling armoured attacks. I call it a stalemate.

It's absolutely true Russia (and Ukraine) are suffering horrific losses. Commentators have been predicting the Russian army would collapse since the first few weeks of the war. Maybe it will eventually happen, like in World War I.

Comment,"Objective answer.  Putin's narrative (like NK, Iran, etc.) is about U.S.-backed oppression/aggression.  Ukraine becoming Westernized - U.S.-backed aggression.  Norway wants to join NATO - U.S.-backed aggression.   So any U.S. backed aggression/oppression, real or not (and their backing of Israel in this situation is of course very real), is low hanging fruit for condemnation from his regime.

Comment,"It's complicated. Russia and Israel have normal diplomatic relations and an Israeli delegation even travelled to meet Putin at the beginning of the Ukraine invasion i order to possibly convince him to chill. They have a certain level of access other western countries don't. Russia also allows Israel to take out targets inside Syria. There are also a LOT of Russian Israelis. But there is caution between the two countries as well based on Russia's ties to Iran and Syria, and Russia's anti-semitic history.

So whether Hamas was supported by Russia via Iran is a question, but an indirect one. It would be counterintuitive for Russia to support Hamas in my opinion. Also Russia doesn't really like terrorist groups e.g. Chechen and solidly supports existing states e.g. Syria. Supporting terrorist groups goes against its stance on sovereignty.",2023-10-30T00:24:14,BowlerSea1569,1,Comment,https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-bombing-gaza-has-killed-50-hostages-hamas-official-tells-russian-2023-10-27/

It is a damning sign when people cheer on nuclear facility attack of any kind. Putting emotions aside, it makes no sense for Russia to attack its own nuclear-related facility. This is similar to Nord Strem pipeline, it made no sense and later was found that Ukraine was most likely the attacker despite everyone blaming Russia.

Comment,"Just to be clear, Pakistan has at various points in time been the destination for Afghan refugees. Post-Soviet invasion, for example, and more recently, the Taliban takeover. 

Many of the Jewish people who immigrated to British Mandated Palestine/Israel were also refugees. The Holocaust in Europe, and persecution in Russia and North African and Arab states were some of the sources of these refugees. 

Are you asking what the reaction would be if Israel kicked out its Jewish refugees?

It is not that strange for mass migrations of people to trigger tense attitudes in the countries which play host to them. You can see this happening today in Poland with Ukrainian refugees. Even in Canada there is some displeasure with the perceived favoritism being shown to Afghan refugees. 

Perhaps without realizing it, you have asked a question which hits at the heart of the current conflict- only in the case of the migration of Jewish peoples to British Mandated Palestine did the migrants declare to themselves an independent nation.

If you can understand how and why immigration can sometimes fray the goodwill of the host population (as in the case of Pakistan), you can understand the root of what's going on in Palestine/Israel today.",2023-10-29T22:21:12,ImranRashid,5,Comment,https://www.foxnews.com/world/pakistan-deport-undocumented-afghan-nationals-un-seeks-relief-deadline

Comment,"Abdullah II is in a pretty precarious position. There are a lot of Palestinian refugees in Jordan, some Jordanians are very sympathetic to the Palestinians, and his wife is a Kuwait-born Palestinian as well.

That being said, Abdullah II is also realistic. He knows first hand what happens when extremism amongst the refugees gains traction, given Black September happened under his father when he was a kid. Abdullah II will probably always try to toe the line as much as possible just to keep the peace, he recognizes Israel as a state and is often the mediator between Israel and Palestine, even being the official guardian of Holy sites in those lands. Jordan has seen a lot of development in its education reforms and equality of genders under Abdullah, and his mother is British. He's a lot more sympathetic to the West than people realize, but he is still the leader of a Muslim nation and people, and I think he realizes that swaying too heavily to one side would be detrimental for Jordan as a whole in terms of civil unrest, etc.",2023-10-29T20:07:38,kikistiel,410,Comment,https://www.reuters.com/world/jordan-says-asked-washington-deploy-patriot-air-defence-missiles-2023-10-29/

Since the 1990s the Navy's public policy is not to load nuclear weapons on anything other than Boomers:

> The declassified numbers end in 1991 with the offloading of non-strategic naval nuclear weapons from US Navy vessels. After that only strategic missile submarines (SSBNs) have continued to deploy with nuclear weapons onboard. Those numbers are still secret.

> The last nuclear weapons division on the USS John F. Kennedy (CV-67) is disbanded in February 1993. The following year the entire surface fleet was denuclearized.

Comment,"I think OP in this chain was suggesting that you wouldn't need the blades, because the kinetic energy caused by a hellfire missile (even if unarmed with explosives) would be enough to kill a soft target (human in a car) with ease. 

But I think the blades are just assurance and help expand the kill area within the impact region. IIRC, when we killed that Iranian general with one, the overall impact area on the car really wasn't that big (could see the hole(s) in the roof). That's all to say, the cross sectional area of the hellfire missile variant was maybe approximately about the size of 3-4 watermelons arranged in a square, at *most* - not sure why I'm using that unit of measurement. 

That's all to say that the blades do make sense, as the**y're** a weight-and space-efficient means of expanding the kill area, on an a missile not equipped with explosives, without requiring a much larger missile, with more fuel, a higher unit cost, etc. Making the missile larger would mean a greater cost, likely higher chance of failure given the thoroughly tested RX9 platform and long history of use, and increase collateral damage due to unburned fuel, larger mass, more debris flying around. Whereas my understanding is the bladed variant of this missile in particular was specifically designed to minimize collateral (and likely in part as a ""flex"" - or because, why not?) damage

That's my take on the OP's comment and my own understanding of why the blades are necessary in this case and are preferable to alternative methods within this particular use case

It's unlikely that their missiles have the range to threaten Israel, which makes his statement basically doubly false. It not only didn't happen, but there's evidence that it couldn't happen.

"1 dead, 3 hurt as multiple blasts rock Western Sahara",,2023-10-29T18:45:35,MaleficentParfait863,51,1,https://www.dw.com/en/1-dead-3-hurt-as-multiple-blasts-rock-western-sahara/a-67249509
Comment,"Article:

**For 30 years, the resource-rich North African desert territory has been 80% controlled by Morocco. But three years ago, the Algeria-backed Polisario Front renewed its armed struggle for independence.**

Four explosions were reported in the city of Smara in Morocco-controlled Western Sahara, local authorities said on Sunday.

One man was killed and three others injured in the blasts, which also damaged two houses, according to a statement by officials.

The AFP news agency cited local authorities as saying the blasts hit three different neighborhoods of Smara.

Two people who suffered serious injuries were transferred to a hospital in Laayoune, 200 kilometers (around 125 miles) west of Smara.

Images on social media, which cannot be verified, show the partially collapsed roof of an empty house as well as some metal debris. 

**Police open investigation into blasts**

The judicial police were investigating the source and nature of the projectiles that hit the residential area, judicial authorities said in a statement.

The attorney general ""has entrusted the investigation team with carrying out the necessary technical and ballistic expertise to identify the origin and nature of the projectiles,"" said a statement quoted by Morocco's MAP news agency.

Situated in North Africa, Western Sahara has been mired in conflict since 1975 when former colonial power Spain withdrew from the territory.

That sparked a 15-year war between the Algeria-backed Polisario Front and Morocco for control over the territory.

A 1991 cease-fire deal gave control of 80% of the desert region to Morocco and Polisario, through the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic, controls the rest and continues to seek an independent state.

Morocco has said autonomy is the most it can offer as a political solution.

**Renewed fight for independence**

In November 2020, Polisario said it had resumed its armed struggle.

Most of the fighting was described by the United Nations as ""low intensity,"" and occurring mostly in the uninhabited eastern part of the Morocco-built security wall.

The UN Security Council has urged the parties to the conflict to seek a mutually acceptable solution.

On Thursday, the Polisario Front said in a statement that it had ""targeted strongholds of Moroccan occupation forces near Hanka Houria"" in the Smara region.

""The attacks by the Sahrawi army continue against the Moroccan occupation forces, which are suffering heavy human and material losses along the wall of shame,"" it added.

The wall, which was erected by Morocco in the 1980s, stretches over 2,700 kilometers (around 1,677 miles) and separates the Morocco-controlled part of Western Sahara from the territory the Polisario considers ""liberated.""",2023-10-29T18:46:41,MaleficentParfait863,8,Comment,https://www.dw.com/en/1-dead-3-hurt-as-multiple-blasts-rock-western-sahara/a-67249509

Comment,"Lol, ok. I‚Äôm totally cool with being on the side that‚Äôs fighting the terrorists who behead infants and toddlers, tortures & kills kids in front of their parents and vice versa, rapes kids and young people, kidnaps innocent babies, kids, women and the elderly, holds civilian hostages in violation of international law (an ACTUAL war crime), and slaughters innocent people. We are absolutely clear that you people like Hamas feel YOU are entitled to kill others when they don‚Äôt do exactly what you want or even if they simply make the ‚Äúmistake‚Äù of being born Jewish. We got it. There is no room in a free world for people like that. So I am absolutely good with Israel eradicating Hamas. Soldiers may have come back and died by suicide after the GWOT, but many of them - the majority of them - live free, peaceful, worthwhile lives in the comfort of a country that recognizes their sacrifice.

Comment,"I know you have the AI and HRW links saying it's apartheid, but neither explain how when Gaza and WB are not part of Israel. They're separated by borders. Whatever happened in Gaza is hamas's fault, they could have used their billions to create their own infrastructure and nation. They didn't. If there's any occupation or apartheid in Gaza, they chose it.   
  
You seem to think hamas has no agency. They could have gotten all their international aid even without Netanyahu, even from western nations. They could have taken the money and played the long game, but instead chose to starve their people. That's on them, Netanyahu doesn't control them.   
   
I wonder where you were on October 07. Did you care about the attacks at all, or you only cared when Israel retaliated?

Comment,"Today I am not sure it is an extremely complex and difficult situation, but if in the past they hadn't seen and used Hamas and other terror organizations as useful counterweight to the moderate parties in the Palestinian Authority that would've been nice. If Israel and the US hadn't after every failed peace talks labeled the Palestinians as the reason for them failing when the truth is the failure is shared between all 3 parties. Finally if Israel would not have been continuing to expand the settlements in the West Bank of which from people on reddit that say they are or know Israelis that the majority of Israelis don't want nor support the settlements.


Copy paste for the 2000 Camp David talks

[https://www.jstor.org/stable/4137467](https://www.jstor.org/stable/4137467)

At Camp David, Israel made a major concession by agreeing to give Palestinians sovereignty in some areas of East Jerusalem and by offering 92 percent of the West Bank for a Palestinian state (91 percent of the West Bank and 1 percent from a land swap). By proposing to divide sovereignty in Jerusalem, Barak went further than any previous Israeli leader.

Nevertheless, on some issues the Israeli proposal at Camp David was notforthcoming enough, while on others it omitted key components. On security, territory, and Jerusalem, elements of the Israeli offer at Camp David would have prevented the emergence of a sovereign, contiguous Palestinian state.

These flaws in the Israeli offer formed the basis of Palestinian objections. Israel demanded extensive security mechanisms, including three early warning stations in the West Bank and a demilitarized Palestinian state. Israel also wanted to retain control of the Jordan Valley to protect against an Arab invasion from the east via the new Palestinian state. Regardless of whether the Palestinians were accorded sovereignty in the valley, Israel planned to retain control of it for six to twenty-one years.

Three factors made Israel's territorial offer less forthcoming than it initially appeared. First, the 91 percent land offer was based on the Israeli definition of the West Bank, but this differs by approximately 5 percentage points from the Palestinian definition. Palestinians use a total area of 5,854 square kilometers.

Israel, however, omits the area known as No Man's Land (50 sq. km near Latrun),41 post-1967 East Jerusalem (71 sq. km), and the territorial waters ofDead Sea (195 sq. km), which reduces the total to 5,538 sq. km.42 Thus, an Israeli offer of 91 percent (of 5,538 sq. km) of the West Bank translates into only 86 percent from the Palestinian perspective.

Second, at Camp David, key details related to the exchange of land were leftunresolved. In principle, both Israel and the Palestinians agreed to land swapswhereby the Palestinians would get some territory from pre-1967 Israel in ex-change for Israeli annexation of some land in the West Bank. In practice, Israel offered only the equivalent of 1 percent of the West Bank in exchange for its annexation of 9 percent. Nor could the Israelis and Palestinians agree on the territory that should be included in the land swaps. At Camp David, thePalestinians rejected the Halutza Sand region (78 sq. km) alongside the GazaStrip, in part because they claimed that it was inferior in quality to the WestBank land they would be giving up to Israel.

Third, the Israeli territorial offer at Camp David was noncontiguous, break-ing the West Bank into two, if not three, separate areas. At a minimum, asBarak has since confirmed, the Israeli offer broke the West Bank into two parts:""The Palestinians were promised a continuous piece of sovereign territory ex-cept for a razor-thin Israeli wedge running from Jerusalem through from \[theIsraeli settlement of\] Maale Adumim to the Jordan River.""44 The Palestinian negotiators and others have alleged that Israel included a second east-west salient in the northern West Bank (through the Israeli settlement of Ariel).45 Iftrue, the salient through Ariel would have cut the West Bank portion of thePalestinian state into three pieces"".

Comment,"The civil war in Lebanon was caused by economic, social, and security issues(the central government had little control over the country and relied on a number of militias to control and ensure security). What is seen as what started the civil war is when the Christian militia attacked a bus carrying Palestinian refugees and the PLO retaliated then it caused counter attacks by each side.

https://www.britannica.com/event/Lebanese-Civil-War

The civil war in Jordan was caused by the PLO, but some background to why should be added when talking about it. The refugees from 1948 were accepted into Jordanian society at least the ones that couldn't or wouldn't claim the right to return mainly the middle and upper class of Palestinians were as the refugees from the Six Day War weren't and both the 1948 and 1967 refugees were treated poorly. The King of Jordan was perfectly fine with the PLO attacking Israel, but didn't want them to do so out of Jordan because he was worried about his place at the top and had been secretly talking with Israel since the 1950s.

You'll have Egypt willing to send Palestinians food and aide. But they are not accepting any of them as refugees or allowing them the settle in Egypt until the fighting in Gaza is over. None of the countries that border Gaza or Israel are willing to do this.

Why? Because there are several examples of Palestinian refugees getting into literal wars with their host countries. There's a reason why many Ukrainian refugees were able to flee the country and live in other European nations, while virtually not a single Middle Eastern country is willing to do the same for Palestine. They'll send Palestinians food and medicine. But nobody wants to actually be the ones who are responsible for dealing with them. Also a good chunk of support Palestinians is motivated largely by spite towards Israel.

Comment,Are the moderate parties in the Palestinian Authority the best option no can there be better parties yes. The Fatah party for all it's flaws and genuine negative attributes has at least formally recognized Israel and wants the 2 state solution. This is a complex and nuanced issue too many people jsut choose to blame one side or the other which depends on which side they belong to. One of the things the world can do is demand that the practice of those pensions be ended or that if not international aid will be reduced by say 20% for the first year then another 5 or 10% every year after and since the Palestinian people rely on that aid and the ruling party does too(embezzlement) then that might just end the practice.,2023-10-29T21:53:36,Longjumping-Jello459,1,Comment,https://www.business-standard.com/world-news/gaza-war-entered-new-stage-and-will-be-long-and-difficult-says-netanyahu-123102900009_1.html

Comment,"Didn't say that either though

Look, you get the point, I appreciate that anyway

The way this works is, Israel's far rightists make deals with Hama's allies (this comes in variable types of exchanges), Hama's allies follow up with arms and supplies sent to Hamas of which Israel doesn't intercept to the full extent of their capability (eg smuggling and bribing) as part of the deal. Give it years, it all trickled in. This has been going on for a while, incidentally while Netanyahu has been in power, and it reached a point (incidentally around when Russia invaded Ukraine) where war planning was then made coordinated by Hama's allies. Again Netanyahu is a known criminal for bribery and fraud.

Then the attack happened

A huge part of the reason why the PA is unpopular among Palestinians is because it cannot and will not protect them against Israeli violence and ever growing settlements taking Palestinian land.

This is also why Hamas can be considered more ‚Äúpopular‚Äù - they promise to protect Palestinians from Israeli aggression. Now the way they do this is by unjustifiable terrorism means, but it explains why Palestinians may be more inclined to be sympathetic to a government that at least claims to protect them.

If Israel wants peace, they need to immediately start normalizing relations with the PA. They need to pledge to start dismantling illegal settlements. They need to show that the PA is a viable option for the Palestinian people that will bring peace and security.",2023-10-29T17:13:29,NivShakakhan,27,Comment,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/29/palestinian-pm-we-will-not-run-gaza-without-solution-for-west-bank

People from Egypt will insist Israel lost the 1973 war, and perhaps strategically Egypt got what they wanted from that war, but the reality was that Israel knocked attacking enemies out of the park and had military superiority.

In the 5th day of the war Israel repelled the attacks and went deep into Syria 30km from Demascus, and towards the end of the war Israel broke Egypt‚Äôs defense and were 100km from Cairo.

Comment,"I don‚Äôt know all the history of Gaza* withdrawal. But it seems like withdrawal was done with no framework for a peaceful government to take hold. It wasn‚Äôt a good plan.

> Sharon suggested his disengagement plan for the first time on December 18, 2003 at the Fourth Herzliya Conference. In his address to the Conference, Sharon stated that ‚Ä≥settlements which will be relocated are those which will not be included in the territory of the State of Israel in the framework of any possible future permanent agreement. At the same time, in the framework of the Disengagement Plan, Israel will strengthen its control over those same areas in the Land of Israel which will constitute an inseparable part of the State of Israel in any future agreement.‚Ä≥[14] It was at this time that he began to use the word ""occupation"". Bernard Avishai states that the Gaza withdrawal was designed to obviate rather than facilitate peace negotiations: Sharon enivisaged at the same time annexing Jerusalem, the Jordan Valley, and the major settlements like Ma'ale Adumim and Ariel which he had in the meantime developed, and thereby isolate Palestinians on the West Bank in territory that constituted less than half of what existed beyond the Green Line.

Comment,"Assuming you're being genuine here:

You need to be in the mindset of people in Gaza. It's a giant refugee camp, 2 million people crammed in the equivalent of a metro area after being driven (often through force) from their homes generations ago. Half the population are children, poverty and malnutrition are rampant. 

If you work on the Israeli side you're subjected to humiliating and seemingly arbitrary searches, which can leave you stranded on one side or the other for days. 

If you ever go near the border fence, you die; sometimes even if you're far away, Israel regularly strikes in Gaza during hot periods. You know babies, mothers and fathers who were incinerated in their homes by Israeli bombs. 

You have no job, no future and no hope, at the constant humiliating mercy of the enemy who lives in your grandparents' home. Is it any surprise that you then turn to people who promise revenge?

It was in Gaza, but that aside, it's pretty crazy to me how Israel leaving Gaza didn't lead to peace. That's such a monumental change for the Palestinians and it turned into more violence.

You can criticize the plan all you like, it doesn't change the fact that it showed Israel that leaving an occupied area wasn't enough to lead to peace, and created a significant terror threat. So the WB unfortunately will remain occupied until the Palestinians can prove that won't happen again in the WB.

Comment,"Part of the withdrawal from Gaza was GWB insisting on democratic elections.  They were held, and Gazans immediately voted for Hamas instead of the PA.  Hamas then immediately started attacking Israel, leading to the blockade of Gaza.

Comment,"The several hundred thousands of original Palestinian refugees have now millions of descendants. When they were originally displaced, hundreds of thousands were granted citizenship in surrounding nations, especially Jordan, but also large numbers in Egypt and in Syria.

A large number of refugees also lived in the West Bank, or as it was called then, Transjordan, which was annexed (illegally) by Jordan, and in Gaza, which was de facto part of Egypt until the six day war. From 1949 until now, even when directly under the governments of Jordan and Egypt, about half of these Palestinians have never been granted citizenship, partly because they have instead been used as a bargaining chip by the Arab League to garner international sympathy for the refugee crisis. It is also true that Palestinian refugees have attempted several coups and assassinations in these countries, but I disagree this is the major reason that refugees have not been more accepted for decades now. There is also a destabilizing effect of large numbers of refugees which Egypt claims, which has some truth to it, but again, all the countries involved have responsibility for these people, regardless of the history, including Egypt.

Israel will not allow them to return to where their ancestors were displaced, because now their population has multiplied several times over and if granted citizenship in Israel, have given all indications that Israel would cease to exist and the Jews would be expelled and massacred. This is what happened to Jews in Jordan, Syria, Egypt, Lebanon, etc. starting in 1947-48. Most recently the last Jews were expelled from Yemen by the Houthi rebels, which is a related topic to look into. These Jews, expelled from countries in the Middle East, mostly during and immediately after the 1948 declaration of the Israeli state and the following war for Independence, when Egypt, Syria, Lebanon and Jordan first attempted to exterminate all Jews in the Levant, make up more than half of Jews in Israel. The remainder are extremely varied, including Jews who fled the Holocaust, Jews who fled pogroms, especially in Eastern Europe, and many other groups.

So the Palestinian Refugees are millions of people trapped in a game of political football, and nobody is blameless. There are no easy one-sided narratives about the history of Israel and Palestine.

Comment,">The current Israeli government doesn't. They've offered multiple two-state deals that were flatly rejected.

This just isn't a factual statement.

The first crucial steps in normalizing diplomacy between the PA and Israel were undertaken by Fatah and the Israeli Labor Party in 1993 - but they were put on hold after Netanyahu won office following the assassination of  Rabin in '95. Coincidentally, some of Netanyahu's campaign stunts included posters with images of Rabin in a set of crosshairs, and a mock funeral procession where pallbearers shouted ""Death to Rabin!"" while parading around a casket with Rabin's image posted onto it. Netanyahu was even made aware by Israel's security chief that there was a plot to kill Rabin, and was asked to please tone it down. *He refused.*

Fortunately, he wasn't in office very long the first time around, and negotiations were reopened under Ehud Barak.

The 2000 Camp David summit saw both sides being willing to make major compromises, but not enough to bridge the gap. There's plenty of blame to be placed on both Israel and the PA for the failure of the Camp David summit, though it's telling that Barak's Foreign Minister (who was present for the accord) stated that ""if I were Palestinian, I would also have rejected Camp David.""

But that wasn't the end of the peace process. They continued to meet and negotiate, with both sides proving willing to make even more concessions on what had been previously un-negotiable maximum demands, and by 2001 at Taba were *just about* to sign a viable, mutually agreeable two-state treaty.

But then Ehud Barak's term ran out, and the Likud party swept into office once more - and, once more, scrapped the plans and shut down negotiations.

The PA has, since '93, been extremely interested in finally coming to a negotiated settlement - much to its own detriment, as Palestinians become increasingly frustrated by the Israeli Right refusing to meet this diplomatic tack in good faith. They've not had a partner willing and able to meet with them for good faith negotiations in the Israeli gov't since 2001, though - and the Likud policy of seeking to consistently delegitimize and destabilize the PA is a major part of why we've arrived at the crisis we currently find ourselves in.",2023-10-29T19:33:29,WillDigForFood,3,Comment,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/29/palestinian-pm-we-will-not-run-gaza-without-solution-for-west-bank

The 2000 negotiations collapsed because post-Rabin, Israel dragged their feet on meeting milestones of the Oslo agreement which destroyed trust between the parties.

The Arabs made a huge mistake in 1948 by attacking the newly-independent state of Israel thinking that they would easily defeat it and force the Jews from the region.

The problem is that instead of recognizing that time was not on their side to make a deal, they kept rejecting deals. Each time, their options get worse, not better.

Comment,"What happened to Olmert's political power after the fact doesn't change the deal that was put on the table as recently as 2008 or that it was indeed put on the table. More importantly for the point I was trying to make is that even a deal like that was rejected. Which is just wild.

That's one of my biggest issues with people pointing to the escalation of settlers in the west bank as reasoning or moral justifying Hamas' actions. We've seen it in Gaza, Israel is willing to remove settlements, and leave behind the greenhouses and other valuable infrastructure the settlers built for the Palestinians. That was on the table for the west bank with the 2008 deal with strong indication Israel has the means conviction to do it.

I do agree though with Iranian funding and their other proxies in the mix there is too much interest in using the Palestinians as pawns to make it anything less than even more difficult to get to peace now. 

On the Israeli end, what 7 October did in its all horror is also make it that much harder to get them to compromise that much again and at some point after several wars to fight of their eradication, and numerous terrorist attack each month, every year for decades on end, its hard not to see their point too.",2023-10-30T00:12:33,jchart049,1,Comment,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/29/palestinian-pm-we-will-not-run-gaza-without-solution-for-west-bank

Comment,I hear your critique and it's not totally unfounded. And going back and forth on what ifs isn't really going to change much. So I guess I'd just end by reminding that it wouldn't be the first time the IDF dragged settlers out of settlements under a right leaning government. I'm not saying it's the most realistic thing (especially now being reminded acutely the consequences of the Gaza withdrawal). I'm just saying I don't think people should be completely doomer pilled on peace even if a post 10/7 Israel goes more rightward.,2023-10-29T21:17:43,af_echad,2,Comment,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/29/palestinian-pm-we-will-not-run-gaza-without-solution-for-west-bank
Comment,"Yessir. Wrap that booger in cobalt and detonate it high in the atmosphere. ‚ÄúWhen the bomb explodes, the neutrons produced by the fusion reaction in the secondary stage of the thermonuclear bomb's explosion would transmute the cobalt to the radioactive cobalt-60, which would be vaporized by the explosion. The cobalt would then condense and fall back to Earth with the dust and debris from the explosion, contaminating the ground.‚Äù*

Comment,I would be more scared for Israeli democracy than for Palestine in that case as the current status quo from before Oct 7 fits the right well enough.  The one possibility for peace under a right wing Israeli government rhat I do see happening is if the US and Europe lays extremely heavy pressure on Israel to actually compromise and stop settlements.

Comment,"I hear ya on the Israeli democracy thing but I also think the whole right/left thing maps weird onto the Israeli public. It's less like purely right/left and more like a few axes of secualr/religious and hard on security/more lenient and then a way less influential economic right/left divide.

And even that probably doesn't cover everything. So while I could see Israel getting more ""right"" on security to an extent, I don't think the hundreds of thousand of people who were protesting Netanyahu's coalition before 10/7 are suddenly going to be ok with his judicial reform plans even if they're now more sympathetic for being tough on security.",2023-10-29T21:33:53,af_echad,1,Comment,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/29/palestinian-pm-we-will-not-run-gaza-without-solution-for-west-bank

Comment,"Israeli citizens didn't deserve to die Oct. 7, 2023, lying in their beds, who had not even gotten up that morning, so the Hamas invaders drug the father, mother and the 7-year-old and the 3-year-old of this home into the TV room and shot all 4 numerous times. While one Hamas invader was going through the frig to find something to eat, the other one took out a machete and cut off all 4 heads after they were dead and then kicked them around the room like a soccer ball.

So, after it was semi safe the IDF sent in a large team to claim the dead. The Israeli in charge of cleaning up that particular house bagged bodies and put in family photos and papers he found to help identify them and placed 3 bags outside and marked the white bags with black marker. The general in charge of the operation came by to inspect and said, ""this house is marked 4 dead and I see only 3 body bags, what's going on?"" The worker said "" Everybody's head was cut off and I could identify the male father and the female mother but when it came to the two little girls, I couldn't tell which head belonged to who, so I put both bodies and both heads in the same bag along with family photos for ID. And that's why there are only 3 body bags for this house!!! The general shook his head and said, ""good job"" ""next house.""

What Hamas did was awful, inexcusable and savage.  Hamas ***is*** pure evil.

Comment,"Obviously no innocent civilian deserves to die and you ask the question knowing he would likely say as much, but you are missing the point anyway. He is expressing that Israel is not upholding its duty to international law with the indiscriminate nature of their attacks. The scale of civilian deaths in this conflict is a direct result of Israel's military tactics, and he is trying to promote the idea that there are avenues between a non-response and leveling neighborhoods that can achieve whatever victory is supposed to be without killing nearly as many innocents. When it's as big an issue as it currently is, their deaths are more remarkably undeserved.

edit: Either Reddit is glitched or the fellow who responded blocked me, here's my response anyway:

Comment,"Us doing this doesn't solve anything, westerners overwhelmingly already believe this as an axiom.

The core problem is that Islamists like Hamas and their supporters explicitly don't believe in equal worth for all humans. For example non-Muslims under Islamic rule are at best second class citizens who must be ""humbled"" and don't have equal worth or rights per Islamic law.

If Hamas achieved their stated goals they would exterminate all Jews and fully implement Islamic law (Sharia) globally. I'm not exaggerating, look at their founding charter.

If Israel achieved their stated goals we would have a two state solution with near-total autonomy for Palestine - the only restrictions being to prevent further attacks on Israel.

Comment,"There is a problem with this. There are a few things Muslims believe that I do not see talked about in here. I've listed a bunch at times but have got downvoted to hell and back because it disagrees with what people like to believe.  
1st and foremost. You CANNOT change faith. Even different branches of Islam. You're a Murtad and the punishment is execution if you don't return to your original faith within 3 days.  
2nd. They traditionally inherit their faith from their fathers.  
3rd. Khalifa, caliphate, Sultan, Imam, whoever rules the land(Hamas, in this case) has the rights to call Jihad, and make decisions on some things.   
4th. They have been absorbed into Hamas and indoctrinated from a very young age using a few things:  
A. School books originally designed by Yaser Arafat's regime.  
B. Mosque prayers and religious gatherings that are optional but if you do not attend them you will be seen as weak of faith so you have to attend them.  
C. Youth groups created by Hamas to attract children to their cause.    
D. Money, Status  and government jobs.  
5th. Salafism is one of the most hardcore branches to ever exist.  
6th. It is in their teachings that killing Jews will get you to heaven and there are no two ways around it.

Comment,"If it is forbidden to fight back against an enemy that uses its own civilians as human shields then why shouldn't every military in the world use that as their official doctrine?

One weird trick to be able to attack others without being attacked yourself.

In fact, why not cut out the middleman: implement a policy that says that for every one of your soldiers on the front lines that the enemy kills, you're also going to execute one of your own people. Therefore, by fighting back, the enemy is killing your noncombatants and ipso facto violating the rules of war.

(The reason militaries don't do this is because it leads to a race to the bottom where the greatest strategic advantage goes to belligerents who care the least about their civilians, and frankly, as civilians, it is in our interest that not caring about us dying does not confer a major strategic advantage to our governments.)",2023-10-29T19:12:20,Fojar38,62,Comment,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/29/hamas-israel-war-palestinian-civilians-jake-sullivan-comments?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other

Comment,"If the opposing side dropped letters, roofknocks, made phone calls to the house, and hamas wouldn‚Äôt let my family leave the building, Id be upset with Hamas for keeping them hostage and using them as moral meat shields.

One side is a government that is for it‚Äôs people, by it‚Äôs people, open to and following international law, accepting criticism and openly admits fault. 

The other is a self-declared terror organization with no regard for the laws of distinction and proportionality, props their own men women and children as sandbags, refuses to engage in any sort of compromise or talks with any foreign body besides the theocratic demagogues tyrannically abusing their own civilians as well (iran), and has shown no interest in peace unless it is on their terms (the slaughter and exile of Jewish people)

The death of civilians is an absurd reality that cant be tolerated. But, what boggles my mind is why anyone pro-Palestinian would protest Israel, who actively wishes and tries so damn hard to root out Hamas without causing any civilian casualties, rather than Hamas, who who are not only wearing these people like armor, but diverting critical resources towards their own interests. 

Hamas does not care to represent the Palestinian people. 
Israel has shown infinitely more concern for them than Hamas ever has, or will, even if you believe for whatever reason it‚Äôs not enough.

Casualties that Israel is going to pains to avoid.

Comment,"War crimes are practically a PR/politics thing. It's a judgement from peer nations in what is or is not acceptable. To some extent the everything is genocide judgement devalues the concept. If a country is treated as if all actions are the same as genocide like the Muslims countries regarding Israel it just licences them to commit more atrocity because they are already suffering the diplomatic damage as of they had done the worst.

Israel is only checked by the US/eu having a significant relationship and holding Israel to some standards.

And extremist recruitment is not only related to atrocity but also propaganda. If the culture is thick with propaganda, they will have no trouble recruiting even in an era where both sides left each other alone. 

You can see many examples where bombs didn't make terrorists. Vietnam after the Americans and French and Cambodian and Chinese invaded.  No vietnamese terrorists.

This is true. However the fact is that conclusively knowing which strikes do this and which don't is impossible in the thick of war absent an independent investigation. However labelling them as war crimes absent an investigation shows us you're not actually interested in the even-handed application of the law but simply want to use the law as a pretense to bash the IDF over your preconceived notions you already have about them.

Proportionality in war isn't a strict numbers game and generally speaking the side that gets to make the call is the side attacking the military target. It becomes even less of one when the enemy is intentionally placing civilians in harm's way. Allowing the tactic to succeed encourages the use of more human shields, which means more civilian deaths and suffering. It is not a war crime to strike a military target that the enemy has intentionally placed around civilians or civilian infrastructure.

Hamas specifically is fighting because they have always believed in total victory over the state of Israel. They are not the PLO and have no interest in a two state solution.

Comment,">It is in fact legal according to the Geneva Convention to attack military targets ""protected"" by human shields, precisely to discourage the use of human shields.

This is correct. But it too has limits, like you described. 

These attacks must still follow the Principle of Proportionality, as defined by International Humanitarian Law. 

Think of it like cost-benefit analysis. The military gain from an individual strike must be proportional to the civilian deaths it causes, as well as the damage it causes to protected objects. Use of human shields doesn't negate that rule, it only affects the calculus, allowing for somewhat larger damage to be caused legally, than under normal circumstances. 

You can't bomb a large crowd of civilians to kill one combatant. That would be a violation of said principle. 

But you can bomb a large concentration of enemy combatants, that is using a small group of civilians as human shields, legally. 

There is no defined cost-benefit ratio, however. That would be something that is decided on a case by case basis, utilising something like the Martens Clause, or Principle of Humanity.",2023-10-29T22:51:27,ThanksToDenial,0,Comment,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/29/hamas-israel-war-palestinian-civilians-jake-sullivan-comments?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other

However thankfully it is true that what could have happened has been curtailed a bit by the US pressure and other pressures. But the invasion hasn't even begun yet this is just the pre-emptory bombing. And everyone can't escape the city in such a tiny small period of time especially when the escape path has been bombed. As a result there's really no positive situation to be discussed here.

Comment,"You can't stay that. You literally can't state that. To state that is to be so devoid of reality and humanity that you become a pointless existence.

You cannot say. ""Escape this way"" because we're coming. In a time period that was unrealistic in even a non war zone situation. And then bomb the areas they're escaping to. You just cannot do that. the UN even tried to sanction them for it and the US is the only one stopping it as they've done for decades and decades with their veto power.

An escape area can not be referred to if it is also a bombing zone. Further they have INCREDIBLY advanced US-top tier parity technology. They can do precision strikes with their missiles. They aren't.

And it's not nuance. It's you trying to ignore the atrocities of one side while hating on the atrocities of another.

Theres a long line of historical indications of evacuating people from dangerous areas. And the main universal thing is that they aren't also blown up on the way. Nor are their families houses then targeted.

Make no mistake, this conflict is complicated, both sides are lesser evils, both sides are guilty, and the current terrorist attack is the responsibility of Hamas and likewise Israel has a right to respond. But after that response and how they respond there will be another response from Hamas and it will feed back into it. And you won't be able to keep saying attacking only one for it.

Comment,"> I've seen plenty criticism of Israel but plenty apologetics for hamas.

Comment,"Speaking for myself, I was as horrified as everyone else I know, by the attack on October 7th. Before we had even had time to process the horror of the reports, thousands of Palestinians including women, children, toddlers and babies, were being indiscriminately killed in retaliation for Hamas' actions, and that has continued every day since, at a rate of one child every 15 minutes.

It's extremely sad that the victims of the terror attacks have not been given more attention and screen time by the media and I can understand the feelings of outrage on behalf of the families of the hostages, whose terrible plight has barely been mentioned in the media coverage of the bombing of Gaza. 

The hostages appear to have been written off by the State of Israel and the US government from day one, as unfortunate victims of unavoidable collateral damage - judging by the political will of Israel in its prioritisation of flattening Gaza in a brutal ongoing collective punishment of the entire population, to avenge the shocking terror attack of October 7.",2023-10-29T19:55:45,throwawayfem77,-7,Comment,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/29/hamas-israel-war-palestinian-civilians-jake-sullivan-comments?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other

With attacks being stopped internally, and foreign aid not being stolen, the reason for the blockade goes away. Rebuilding can happen. With some time and good will, it may be possible that Gaza would not be an immediately hostile state, and negotiating a two state solution might resume.

No, what will happen is that Hamas will continue to embed themselves as deeply as possible into civilian population centres, continue hoarding all the resources as their own people starve, and continue trying to kill every single Jew in the middle east. Because if you tell a terrorist that being near a civilian is an impenetrable shield, they will hold on to that shield for dear life. Meanwhile if you accept some bar of collateral damage, of tragic, awful, heart-wrenching civilian death, then the terrorist doesn't have the incentive to endanger any more civilians.

This is a very uncompelling argument though. When we have a criminal hostage situation, do we call for the police to just shoot the hostages so they can get the bad guys? No, we don't. So why is this an exception where suddenly it's ok to shoot innocent bystanders?

Imo, you can either condemn someone for using human shields, _or_ you can justify killing the human shields because of their status as human shields. You can't do both, and I'm unwilling to go back on my morals regarding the first.",2023-10-30T00:06:54,Tasgall,1,Comment,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/29/hamas-israel-war-palestinian-civilians-jake-sullivan-comments?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other
Comment,"Then you‚Äôre not paying attention and need to read a history book. The IDF has absolutely gone door to door and killed innocent people (go read up Dair Yassin where they did exactly that, go read up on Plan Dalet, go read up on how they marched 3000 Palestinians at gun point into the Red Sea and watched them drown)

Israeli human rights organizations have documented for years the fact that the IDF shoots and throws grenades at Palestinians for sport. Hell, the Israelis were the first to start bombings when Igrun blew up the King David hotel in Jerusalem in 1946. They also don‚Äôt like to talk about the fact the Mossad ran a campaign of false flag terrorist attacks against Jews in Iraq because they were too well integrated and didn‚Äôt want to move.

Picking sides in this conflict is stupid - the political leadership of both countries derives all its power and legitimacy from its continuation. That is obviously true for Hamas and the PLO, but it is equally true for the Israeli government where every PM since Ben-Gurion has built their political career on how tough they are on the Palestinians. There‚Äôs a reason why an utter crook like Netanyahu is in power and it‚Äôs not because Israel is a ‚Äúforce for good‚Äù. It hasn‚Äôt been since it‚Äôs first action was to assassinate the first special rapporteur the UN sent down there.

The international community needs to stop picking sides in this conflict . Both entities need to be hit with crushing sanctions until the bullshit stops and they find a way to live together. Either that, or we need to step in and dismantle both countries and built them up again.

Comment,"Japan really is not a good comparison at all. For starters, their feelings towards the U.S. no way matched that of the members of Hamas. They certainly did not like the U.S., but their hatred was much more geared towards nations like China they saw more as their historical rivals. Additionally, Japan was able to change its opinion with time given that they didn't really lose any of what they saw as their land (Manchuria, parts of China, etc. that they occupied were of course lost, but those were recent conquests). In fact, for the only place where they sort of did, Okinawa, which has a large chunk used as a U.S. military base, there is still a lot of resentment towards the U.S. in contrast, even if Palestine is allowed to keep the territory it does now, which I sort of doubt Israel would allow if it commits to a complete invasion, they will still long for the territories they lost decades ago they see as their ancestral claims. That is something you can't undo so easily, especially when they witness many of their friends and family dying to Israeli bombs. Really, that's one of the main issues here: Japan was able to change because they didn't really lose much in the long-term to make them vengeful. Moreover, the war was for less than a decade, not the several decades long conflict between the Palestinians and Israelis.

Comment,"Yes, ""legally"", it becomes a target. That doesn't necessarily make it right to blow up the hospital to target them. You have to weigh the costs in civilian lives versus the losses for the enemy, and bombing a hospital does a lot of damage to the civilians in the short and long term while you aren't even guaranteed to damage the headquarters, much less kill any Hamas members.

Hamas is in the wrong for blurring the line, but the IDF does not get a pass for killing civilians. Also, of course sources don't say whether the dead are part of Hamas or not - its already hard most of the time to ID different bodies, much less tell whether said bodies were part of an organization without any standard uniform or database of members. However, given the targeted areas are dense residential areas and as you said, Hamas tends to hide among civilians, chances are many of those deaths are civilians. This becomes even worse when you consider almost half the population is made up of children, so there's also a good chance many of the dead are literal children.",2023-10-29T19:30:00,UncreativeIndieDev,1,Comment,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/29/hamas-israel-war-palestinian-civilians-jake-sullivan-comments?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other

Sounds like a great opportunity to undermine them, then. Send in teams to distribute aid to individuals. Make it very clear that you will do so in advance, so that the local population knows that anyone who tries to stop you is their enemy. If nobody stops you, you have provided humanitarian aid and built local rapport for whoever you claim to represent. If somebody does, they discredit themselves. Either can be leveraged to undermine Hamas socially, denying them future recruits, and shifting the public opinion against them.

Basically the more innocents you kill or displace the more Hamas / the idea of terrorism grows among the survivors. The US eventually emphasized a ""hearts and minds"" approach in an attempt to show an alternative way forward.

Furthermore, all these pro-Hamas morons accusing Israel of genocide would be laughable if it weren't such a problem.  The problem is that misapplication of that word is crying wolf, diminishing the seriousness of genocide, doing a disservice to humanity.

Hamas charter calls for the destruction of Israel and the death of all Jews.  This is textbook genocidal intent.  Israel is a multi-cultural, multi-ethnic democracy with over 2M Arab inhabitants who participate in a vibrant society as IDF soldiers, members of Knesset, mayors, etc.   Many were victims of the Hamas attack.  If Israel wants to wipe out the Arab population they're doing a poor job of it as the Arab population of Israel has grown from 156,000 right after Israel defeated the Arab nations that attacked her in 1948 to 2.1M now.  A >10x growth in population over 75 years is hardly indicative of genocidal intent.

As such, Israel are committing war crimes (as are Hamas, to be clear).

>(a) those who plan or decide upon an attack shall:

>(i) **do everything feasible to verify that the objectives to be attacked are neither civilians** nor civilian objects and are not subject to special protection but are military objectives within the meaning of paragraph 2 of Article 52 and that it is not prohibited by the provisions of this Protocol to attack them;

>(ii) t**ake all feasible precautions in the choice of means and methods of attack with a view to avoiding, and in any event to minimizing, incidental loss of civilian life**, injury to civilians and damage to civilian objects;

>(b) **an attack shall be cancelled** or suspended if it becomes apparent that the objective is not a military one or is subject to special protection or that **the attack may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects**, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated;  
>  
>(c) effective advance warning shall be given of attacks which may affect the civilian population, unless circumstances do not permit.

Are you trying to read that kind of statement in good faith, or are you deliberately interpreting it in bad faith? Because that as a statement doesn't condone what Hamas did, it's a matter of whether or not this was a foreseeable attack. Push a wild animal into a corner, you shouldn't be surprised when you get bit. That doesn't mean you deserved to get bit, it's a matter of predictability.

Israel intended to shoot Gaza before this conflict? What? [Have you seen the Gaza population balloon in the past decade?](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Gaza-Strip-Population-Forecast-Results_fig2_262201993)

Or are you saying that Israel intends to shoot Hamas now, after their attack, in which case they'd already have stolen the hostage before they were cornered.

What the fuck is this analogy, lmao. The criminal would've basically had to have raped the police chiefs daughter, threw their newly born nephew into the oven, shot some other people just for the fuck of it, then took someone hostage because he knew the police department was going to come after him. Then on top of that, the criminal would have to have a secret underground tunnel where he's trying to infiltrate the police department headquarters (possibly for rape? maybe just to murder more?).

And also, the criminal would be actively shooting people with the hostage as protection. So yes you'd shoot the perpetrator. That's an easy, ""take the shot"".

Bro, this analogy is stupid as fuck. You don't understand the point of analogies. An analogy is just a microcosm. We're not going to find an analogy for the current conflict.

> The criminal grabs an innocent bystander and uses them as a human shield. Do you shoot and kill the innocent person before shooting the criminal or do you attempt to de-escalate first?

The answer is that you'd try to de-escalate first. But this example doesn't carry over to the current conflict for reasons I already explained.

Comment,"You have a good point about the differences.  Japan did lose the idea that they were an empire.  Israel has no long-term interest in occupying Gaza -- not only have they announced this, but they departed completely in 2005.  

Are you arguing that no Japanese civilians witnessed the deaths of the \~3M Japanese civilians who died in WW2?  That they were oblivious to the bombings of Tokyo, Hiroshima, Nagasaki, etc.?

I agree that invasion will not, by itself, produce deradicalization.  I think that capitulation is an important step on the way to it.  Also, UNRWA has done the world a disservice with its grooming of terrorists -- perhaps a better educational effort might yield more peaceful results.

The day after the invasion is a worthy topic of discussion.  I wish I could snap my fingers and end violent jihad as an ideology, or I wish I could click my heels and have the populations across the middle east who have been taught and encouraged for generations to hate Israel accept that she is there to stay.

Comment,"> As the US proved through two wars in the middle east

It's effectively a couple of cities with a bit of countryside around it. This isn't Afghanistan, this isn't Iraq. An area of this size is a totally different beast than large countries. There are no mountains or remote villages where the terrorists can hide, only tunnels, which can be located and destroyed until there are none left. Hamas are stupid enough to attack from tunnel exits, making them both easy targets and giving those away.

> how much recruitment in Hamas 

Hamas are able to recruit, because they are the government of Gaza. They have control over people's lives. Schools, universities TV programs, social media, newspapers. They control health insurance and collect taxes, they issue permits and punish both ordinary criminals and those who work against them.

By eliminating Hamas as a government, they can never ever do anything like they did on October 7 ever again. That's the goal. Of course there will be some stragglers and splinter groups that might launch the occasional suicide bombing in the future, but those are manageable. As a large organization however, Hamas is on its deathbed.

> Oh and I'm sure withholding food and water is a great way to win hearts and minds

You don't supply your enemy during a war. Hamas has horded food, water, medical supplies and fuel for months. They are not giving it out. Israel is already sending in aid into areas they have seized from Hamas and have agreed on more aid from Egypt. 

That said, winning hearts and minds is not the goal of Israel. They are there to eliminate a threat to their national security. They are doing it as humanely as they can, but there is no perfect way of conducting warfare.

Comment,"Don‚Äôt answer the question with sarcasm. Really, for a moment critically think: What the hell should Israel do? 

This situation is the textbook case of terror. They make you choose between two evils. Even if you do your best to mitigate damage, you still commit an atrocity. But your hand is forced. 

Should we try to talk it over? Well my enemy has declared religious Jihad on me and has no interest in seeing me or my civilians as humans, so i think compromise is kinda off the table. 

Do I make a concession? Maybe that will appease them and we can reach compromise at least? Well we tried that, didnt go well. They elected a Jihad group that vowed eternally to seek our destruction rather than accept the billions in foreign aid coming from nearly every place on earth. 

Now they‚Äôre shooting missiles at our cities indiscriminately! Thousands of them! Thank God the Americans have given us a missile defense system, otherwise the casualties would be so high it makes current palestinian death tolls look tiny.

They‚Äôre still bombing us! Talks arent leading anywhere! Breaking news: Terror group that vows eternal vengeance will not stop terrorizing! 

We have to respond by destroying Hamas infrastructure and the senior officials, this is unsustainable! The problem is they are building tunnel systems, weapon caches, ect. Under civilian infrastructure! 

Thats basically forcing your innocent civilians to join a war they want nothing to do! Lets try and drop leaflets, roofknocks, and make phone calls to get the civilians to leave! 

Oh Hamas wont let them? Almost seems like they built the military infrastructure within the civilian infrastructure to keep you from attacking. After all, you wouldn‚Äôt hurt a civilian, right? That‚Äôd be evil. Truly, unforgiving and downright despicable.

Comment,"Resolution 181 was rejected by the Arab nations. Then they attacked Israel the day after they declared their independence because they refused to recognize it. Five countries tried to invade and lost. Israel didn‚Äôt start that war but they did protect themselves. And a lot of those same people have never let go of that anger and hate. It also wasn‚Äôt the first act of aggression, the land was historically rife with unrest.

If it was actually about the land, they would have tried to re-negotiate the terms. But it‚Äôs simply the fact that they wanted Jews gone. 

There‚Äôs also the fact that you will try to claim the Jews stole the land but the truth is they have lived on said land for thousands of years, they had been legally purchasing land as early as the 1880‚Äôs, they were given land by the occupying power at the time, and they took over land after they finished a war they didn‚Äôt start. 

Pretty much every attempt at peace has been rejected by one side. Israel has had to put up borders and restrictions because of the constant terror attacks, they had to create the Iron Dome because the constant barrages.

And when Israel left Gaza in 2005 (including removing their own people‚Äôs settlements), Hamas violently took over. And they‚Äôve spent the past nearly two decades terrorizing Israel and their own people, as well as radicalizing them. They‚Äôve taken the billions in aid and used it to secure weapons to commit constant terror attacks, including the most recent horrific one on 10/7. And they‚Äôve done so to the detriment of their own people, they steal and hoard supplies, they use their civilians as human shields, they prevent them from fleeing and leaving, they blow up their own people. Did you know that something close to a fifth of their own rockets launched at Israel, fail and land on their own land? They have received billions in humanitarian aid and they literally don‚Äôt even provide the most basic resources for their own people. They literally dug up their own water pipes and used the material for rockets.

Comment,"Per international law voluntary human shields are direct participants in the hostilities. If they're 'protecting' military sites by their presence and not being coerced, their injury or death are not violations.

For involuntary human shields placed to protect military targets, the attacking force has to make a judgment about whether the military purpose is worth it. However, that determination rests with the attacker and the deaths of the civilians are upon the heads of the individuals that forced them to be involuntary human shields. The presence of human shields does not and will never render any target immune to military action by their presence. It does not require an attacking force to place their own forces in harms way in order to reduce injury/death of human shields. And allowing human shields to do so would merely encourage the future use of more human shields, resulting in even more death.

Murdering of journalists has already been proven, not just now, but in the past as well. Even killing aid workers and such. Oppression via economics, oppression via illegal settling, etc.

I recognize Israel is one of those topics people want to put-context less statementss to, but the reality is that this isn't a good vs evil war. It's a lesser of two evil's type of war, with civilians on both sides getting caught in the middle, one for religious purposes and oppression purposes and one for religious and corruption purposes. And then the US is there backing one side up because way back when when we were hands off our CIA detected code words referring to suspected nuclear arms locations they would detonate if they were lost, and thus had a rapid mass air-drop of supplies and equipment and have been supplying them ever sense, largely to use them as a lightning rod for conflict in the Middle East so the US doesn't get dragged into many conflicts.

That's the situation over there. Plus the current leader of the government has been actively trying to suppress his peoples rights to remove or hold him accountable in the courts by changing the very abilities of the courts to him him accountable.

Meanwhile a terrible terrorist attack occurs due to propaganda and extremism and religion, ands ome people joining in on it via radicalization because of how Israel treated them, others just being extremists. Hostages get taken, civilians are lost heavily.

The war is good for Israel, it helps distract from Netanyuhu's many issues. Whether he had reports and intelligence referring to the oncoming attack and poorly responded intentionally is still unknown and we may never know since that data often gets squelched or suppressed for years. OR perhaps we will.

Regardless, while Israel has the right to respond regardless of the things they did to influence the tension in the first place, it would be a complete lie to the highest degree to claim they're being responsible in their handling of things. How much worse would it even be without the US President and other leaders trying to directly mediate and lessen the current already horrific response?

Comment,"There is a lot more history in Gaza there than the narrative ‚ÄúIsrael is gobbling up all the land‚Äù (West Bank, on the other hand, is a fucked up settled policy).  

Israel offered Gaza back to Egypt to no avail.  It is also a source of significant attacks on Israel and its citizens.  It is just a gordian with no obvious solution.  Hamas being in power prevents any stable, peaceful solution, especially after the 10/7 massacres.

Maybe the solution is making it an international city administered by the UN.  It (in theory) would reduce security concerns for Israel, allow for civilian infrastructure to be built up, and create conditions for a successful and peaceful Palestinian administration.

But my gif would that plan be difficult as all hell to successfully execute and expensive to boot.

Comment,"You have to go way further back than that. I just recently saw a redditor share a detailed story about how the IDF is founded on anti Arab sentiment and a historic offshoot of violent and horrific Jewish militant groups who terrorized the Arab communities of Palestine, causing the mass exodus and subsequent invasion by Israel‚Äôs neighbors.  

Except when I looked it up I discovered that the IDF was formed out of the paramilitary group that CONDEMNED those groups and had multiple armed conflicts with them to try and stop their efforts with casualties on both sides. The group has its historic issues as well but they were founded as a defensive force after Jewish communities were consistently attacked by their Arab neighbors and their major historic enemy were the British colonists that were deporting Jews and denying visas that were promised. 

I was blown away to learn about how many times the Jews had been driven out of the region throughout history and how their most recent immigration back to the region was one of several throughout history.",2023-10-29T22:41:05,Notfriendly123,1,Comment,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/29/hamas-israel-war-palestinian-civilians-jake-sullivan-comments?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other

Comment,"No way at all.

Comment,">Nonsense. The casualties are heavier on one side simply due to technological differences. If the thousands of rockets Hamas has been firing weren‚Äôt being intercepted by the iron dome the casualty numbers would look very different. 

Doesn't seem like a technological difference to kill Gazan non-terrorists because of failed terrorist attacks. It seems more like Israel places little to no value on Gazan civilians.

>Also nonsense on indoctrination‚Ä¶ there are 2 million Arabs who live in Israel - 20% of population. Israel was willing to split the land in two(Oslo accords), Hamas formed very much to stop that with terror attacks and succeeded. Hamas‚Äô charter in clear black and white states that not an inch of land is to be given to the Jews and the only acceptable way to deal with Jews is jihad. 

>Heck a Gallup poll from a week before Oct 7th attacks showed that 72% of Gaza population do not want a two state solution. They‚Äôre not interested in peace, they want ALL of the land. One guess on how they‚Äôd like to accomplish that goal? The Jews are living in peace with 20% of their population that are Arab and were willing to split the whole thing.

The Israelis believe they have the right to a native people's land, and that they have no choice but to kill thousands and thousands of innocent natives to defend that right. That may make sense to Israel, but obviously it is nonsense to those native people. Both are as indoctrinated as the other from their perspective.

Comment,"Personally, I think reconciliation is a pretty obvious step. End the mistreatment of Palestinian with the West Bank and israel, have the blockade only refuse to allow weapons through, and start proposing solutions that aren‚Äôt heavily biased towards Israel. One of the main factors that cause radicalism is poverty, and israel has been ensuring that the Palestinians stay that way. I‚Äôm pretty sure they literally refuse to allow fishing boats from going to far out from the coast, and only some days allow Palestinian farmers to till their own land, it‚Äôs clear the poverty is very much due to Israel‚Äôs doing. With the actual proposing of a reasonable solution as a stepping stone and a great reduction of poverty in Gaza, and the removal of the West Bank settlements, Palestinians would have a way to attain their freedom or country or independence or whatever you wanna call it in a way that doesn‚Äôt require them to take it, and with that realization, support for Hamas would decline.

Comment,"When I hear ""destroy"" Hamas - I hear meaningless soundbites born of a fucking horrific trauma.

They flattened whole neighborhoods - a few nights ago they reported 1 Hamas higher up and some dozen foot soldiers killed - that was their result of droping 600 bombs that night ... surely those 600 only hit the same spot.

How many bombs did they drop in the last 3 weeks? 10k? I would call that bombing to pieces. And Hamas is still able to fire rockets.

They go in by ground because bombing did not solve the problem for the past x years.

How do you keep 10 guys pooping out of their tunnels, wielding AKs from going to your roof, fire their rockets and leave. Sure you would heroiclly stand there and tell them ""not on my roof"", get shot in the head and thats it ...

If the unarmed civilians would be able to removed Hamas from their tunnels - why the ground offensive including bombing for 3 weeks by IDF?

What IDF is doing there is forcing a humanitarian disaster onto 2.4 civilians in the hope that they will turn against Hamas. Some medival tactics there ... One might think of international humanitarian law.

Just listen to Yuval Harari or Gideon Levy or anything other than IDF spokesperson XY endlessly repeating ""they started it"" when questioned critically about their plan, hostages or basically anything. Hamas bad so anything goes.

Not to mention - their glorious exit strategy - we decide when its over and the international community/arab states can fix it afterwards because we are not responsible for those people we bombed for months, while controlling their water, food, electricity - they should just pull themselfs up by their bootstraps I guess ... like in the westbank - that glorious utopia just over the next hill ...",2023-10-29T21:03:01,Kuhbar,-1,Comment,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/29/hamas-israel-war-palestinian-civilians-jake-sullivan-comments?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other

I'd contest that the above may be used as a defense, but even if used as (voluntary/involuntary, who's to say) human shields, there remains a bare minimum responsbility to understand the potential loss of civilian life (which would inform that defense / decision making). I mean, you'd need to understand what and where civilians are in the area to judge if they are being used as human shields.

Comment,"I am aware of the multiple attempts at different political solutions over the decades. Both sides have backed out of them at different points.

The reality is I don't see the Palestinians accepting anything then less then 50% of the land and the ""holy sites"" back.

The problem is I don't ever see Israel being willing to make an offer like that.

Additionally like you mentioned there would be a huge logistical burden in an equitable land transfer agreement as Israelis are living in a lot of that land now and would need to be relocated.

The problem is Hamas or something like it will always exist as long as you have millions of people corralled into what are basically fenced and walled off prison cities. That very environment itself breeds it. Coming down too hard on the Palestinians or just wiping them out is not really an option unless you want an entire regional war (which may happen anyway).

Comment,"The maths on the Napoleonic wars is, from quick research, about 750,000 or 0.075 per cent of the human population at the time. Mostly in the invasion of the Russian Empire.

Comment,">The fact that the Hamas attacks ‚Äòdidn‚Äôt happen in a vacumn‚Äô yet they‚Äôre condeming Israel for their response is biased and bullshit. 

The Secretary General's point is more nuanced than a condemnation of Israel for their response. It focuses on the wars effect on civilians. The condemnation is focused on both Hamas attacks, tactics and on specific instances of IDF actions which resulted in civilian deaths or massive upheaval.

""It is important to also recognize the attacks by Hamas did not happen in a vacuum.

The Palestinian people have been subjected to 56 years of suffocating occupation. 

They have seen their land steadily devoured by settlements and plagued by violence; their economy stifled; their people displaced and their homes demolished.  Their hopes for a political solution to their plight have been vanishing.

But the grievances of the Palestinian people cannot justify the appalling attacks by Hamas.  And those appalling attacks cannot justify the collective punishment of the Palestinian people.""

The relentless bombardment of Gaza by Israeli forces, the level of civilian casualties, and the wholesale destruction of neighborhoods continue to mount and are deeply alarming. 

I mourn and honour the dozens of UN colleagues working for UNRWA ‚Äì sadly, at least 35 and counting ‚Äì killed in the bombardment of Gaza over the last two weeks.

I owe to their families my condemnation of these and many other similar killings.

The protection of civilians is paramount in any armed conflict.""

Protecting civilians can never mean using them as human shields.

Protecting civilians does not mean ordering more than one million people to evacuate to the south, where there is no shelter, no food, no water, no medicine and no fuel, and then continuing to bomb the south itself.""",2023-10-29T21:17:18,Ornery_Tension3257,11,Comment,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/29/hamas-israel-war-palestinian-civilians-jake-sullivan-comments?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other

Comment,"> So why did Netahyahu and the Israeli govt support their take over of Gaza?

Because they knew Hamas would undermine the Palestinian cause. The same reason why the DNC elevated Trump to be nominee for the GOP back in 2016. Better to manipulate your enemies into picking a weak leader and then fight them.

Granted it didn't work out for the DNC in 2016 and I doubt it'll work out for Israel either.

Because it's not really possible to isolate a government without hurting it's citizens.

Comment,"Targeting the civilian population has been a military tactic for millennia. I can see how you would think it is only common now however, It was just until recently that the world seen it as detrimental and created international laws to combat it. That‚Äôs the problem with terror groups they do not follow the laws of warfare or international law at all, they wear civilian clothing which makes it difficult to see them as combatants to the public eye. It‚Äôs optics. 


You need to understand the laws of warfare, especially for a NIAC. It specifically mentions that targeting civilians is forbidden, however the exemption is if the military necessity calls for it. The situation in Gaza unfortunately calls for the destruction of the overlapping civilian infrastructure because Hamas constructed tunnels spanning across Gaza. These tunnels are used to store munitions, troop movements, transport supplies etc.  Everything done so far in this specific conflict, which can be seen publicly has been in accordance with international law of armed conflicts. 

If you would like I can email you a copy of the 1300 page manual on laws of war

Comment,"> Why would a hypothetical illegality make an actual illegality legal?

It is absurd to expect Israel to face repeated aggression from its neighbours under threat of annihilation and genocide if wars are lost, with no ability to retain any territory won to establish defensible boundaries.

This is why when the UN resolved that Israel should give back territory after the 1967 war the wording was very specific:

> Lord Caradon, chief author of the resolution, takes a subtly different slant. His focus seems to be that the lack of a definite article is intended to deny permanence to the ""unsatisfactory"" pre-1967 border, rather than to allow Israel to retain land taken by force. Border rectification by mutual agreement is allowed:
>
> Knowing as I did the unsatisfactory nature of the 1967 line I was not prepared to use wording in the Resolution which would have made that line permanent. Nevertheless it is necessary to say again that the overriding principle was the ""inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war"" and that meant that there could be no justification for annexation of territory on the Arab side of the 1967 line merely because it had been conquered in the 1967 war. The sensible way to decide permanent ""secure and recognized"" boundaries would be to set up a Boundary Commission and hear both sides and then to make impartial recommendations for a new frontier line, bearing in mind, of course, the ""inadmissibility"" principle.[25]
>
> Q. But how would one change the previous border without the acquisition of territory by war? Are you suggesting mutual concessions, that is, that both Israel and the Arabs would rationalize the border by yielding up small parcels of territory? A. Yes, I'm suggesting that... Q. And that this should be mutually done, with mutual territorial concessions? A. Yes, yes. To the benefit of all.

Comment,"Well for one, none of those examples are relevant because none of those are governments.

During World War 2, Allied Forces instituted blockades of Japan and Germany. Nuclear bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Dresden was bombed into rubble.

During the Gulf War, 100,000 civilians were killed in bombing raids and clashes between military forces.

Hamas aren't just a random terrorist organization. They're the governing force of Gaza and the legitimate rulers of that area. They're labeled as terrorists is due to their warfare tactics and for PR reasons. But they're infrastructure, home bases, and supply routes are linked to that of the civilian population. Trying to fight Hamas without hurting civilians is logically impossible.

Comment,"Israel has a \*lot\* of intel on Hamas infrastructure -- where they fire from, where they store their weapons, where their tunnels are, and that they located their HQ under Gaza's biggest hospital.

Why did Hamas do this?  A few reasons.

First, they are cowardly.  

Second, they are selfish.  They know that israel is ethical and will not destroy all life in Gaza, so Israel will be compelled by its morals to go into Gaza on the ground to root out Hamas while minimizing civilians casualties.  They know they will lose and lose their lives, but their hope is to kill a few Israelis on the way.  In their twisted minds, they think they'll get more virgins in heaven that way.  It really doesn't matter to them if civilians are harmed along the way.  In fact, it is a plus as they can use claims of civilian damage and deaths in their PR war against Israel

""Knowing as I did the unsatisfactory nature of the 1967 line I was not prepared to use wording in the Resolution which would have made that line permanent.

The sensible way to decide permanent ""secure and recognized"" boundaries would be to set up a Boundary Commission and hear both sides and then to make impartial recommendations for a new frontier line, bearing in mind, of course, the ""inadmissibility"" principle.[25]""

It doesn't, but the 1967 lines aren't set in stone.

The settlers aim to make extensive territory gain a fait accomplis. China annexed Tibet, Turkey effectively annexed Northern Cypress. Both of these were illegal actions by your criteria but are widely accepted.

Comment,"> A large part of 9/11 was orchestrated by Saudis. Did the US blockade Saudi Arabia and start bombing civilian centres?

A fatuous comparison.

Most of the 9/11 terrorists were Saudis, true, but they were living in Afghanistan and using Afghanistan as a training ground and staging area for their attacks. Most of the leadership of Al Qaeda was also not Saudi. There was also no evidence the Saudi government was involved in the plot, and they have always denied any involvement. 

To make it simpler: If a bunch of Irish guys move to Somalia and attack Turkey, you would invade Somalia, not Ireland.

Duh.

Edit: Also, just remembered, Al Qaeda hated the Saudi government and the royal family because after Iraq annexed Kuwait prior to the first Gulf War and started lining up along the border to Saudi Arabia so they could take the Saudi oil fields next, Bin Laden made an offer to the king to come bring Al Qaeda to help protect the holy land of Saudi Arabia. The Saudi king said, thanks but no thanks, we need real fighters, and practically pleaded with the US-led coalition to do something. Bin Laden and Al Qaeda never forgave the Saudi government for allowing the unforgivable sin of letting infidel boots touch the holy ground of Saudi Arabia. They took it as a personal affront to their honor, and Al Qaeda even mentioned it was one of the reasons they perpetrated 9/11.",2023-10-29T22:45:26,TooApatheticToHateU,2,Comment,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/29/hamas-israel-war-palestinian-civilians-jake-sullivan-comments?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other

Israel doesn't want to bomb civilians either.

They use smaller, guided munitions to minimize civilian casualties.  Many times they have called for civilians to evacuate the north of Gaza.  They have phoned residents of buildings about to come under attack in order to warn them to leave immediately. They monitor the movement of people through cell-tower info in order to tell which neighborhoods are less densely populated.

How will denying electricity, water, food and healthcare to kids and civilians help remove Hamas?

1) Don't help Hamas get into power in the first place and stop being Machveilli

2) Don't collectively punish the population with blockades - it simply makes worse living standards, a bad economy and creates a desperate population easily radicalized and recruited by terrorists.

3) Replace military solutions with political solutions.  For instance, the UK did not solve the NI troubles by militarily beating the IRA.  They set up power-sharing agreements, disarmament.

4) Focus on rebuilding Gazan infrastructure and economy.  That's why the Marshall plan succeeded (and yes, that involved a genocidal country) - it didn't repeat the WWI mistaking of punishing a side, but rather rebuilding its economy.",2023-10-29T22:39:30,kw_hipster,0,Comment,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/29/hamas-israel-war-palestinian-civilians-jake-sullivan-comments?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other

Why did Netahyahu continue to support Hamas after the election?

They are blockading Gaza to hurt Hama but then letting them receive cash from Qatar?  


""Meanwhile, Israel has allowed suitcases holding millions in Qatari cash to enter Gaza through its crossings since 2018, in order to maintain its fragile ceasefire with the Hamas rulers of the Strip.""

""Most of the time, Israeli policy was to treat the Palestinian Authority as a burden and Hamas as an asset. Far-right MK Bezalel Smotrich, now the finance minister in the hardline government and leader of the Religious Zionism party, said so himself in 2015.  
According to various reports, Netanyahu made a similar point at a Likud faction meeting in early 2019, when he was quoted as saying that those who oppose a Palestinian state should support the transfer of funds to Gaza, because maintaining the separation between the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank and Hamas in Gaza would prevent the establishment of a Palestinian state.""

There will never be a right to return in the sense asked for by the PLO, that would destroy Israel as a Jewish national home.

Pretty much my entire point. However that would require Israel acknowledge the validity of the UN position on occupied lands. So far not.

Conquest does not in itself negate the rights of prior inhabitants to their land. That would have to be an issue for negotiation.

Probably yes, but relative to the larger land at stake a minor adjustment.

The key words in your comment are ""in the USA set fire."" They didn't set fire to a consulate in Canada.

In Canada protesters have routinely burned/hung politicians, including Trudeau, in effigy.  We do not imprison people for even wildly objectionable political speech, and we don't coddle the pathetic sensibilities of our politicians.

If anyone in Canada issued an actual threat, no fires needed, just a real threat, then they would be arrested. Hell it has happened many times. The idea that someone says something that is disagreeable can be translated into a ""threat"" is an idea that is contrary to the rule of law.

Moreover, if a foreign government thinks the Canadian government is ""being dismissive"" it is simply not acceptable solution to send assassins to commit extra-judicial killings. This is the conduct of a cowardly bully, not a mature leader.

Indian nationlists on this very sub have made bizarre statements that it is ""routine"" for major powers to conduct assassinations in other countries and similar vile commentary. Anyone who believes that being a ""major power"" means it is okay to conduct murder campaigns does not believe in the rule of law, nor democracy, nor basic human decency.

Politicians in India get the effigy treatment  including quite often a garland of slippers on a donkey in effigy  without india melting down. Probably more , too.  A few  incidents and reddit goes off the deep end, making Modi govt the next thing to goebbels 

The point is that the ""who"" is very significant part of threat assessment,  not just the ""what"". And there's a difference in perception of the innocence of the who. Random office goer armchair wannabe making a threat is different from core group with history making a threat (as a hypothetical ) 

I feel you completely missed that point.


If you see the protesting guys as just normal canadian protesters, yes, sure. If you see them as a front , organized and infiltrated by a group that just burnt your embassy, different . With the same actions.


Also the base level of violence in Canadian society is generally low. India is much more variable,being a much more diverse subcontinent.

Sikh separatism was at its fever pitch when Congress party, the current opposition was in power in 80s. They curb stomped it in 80s. The horrific anti sikh riots of Delhi happened when Indian prime minister from that party was assassinated by her sikh bodyguards. And this party is purportedly secularist and civic nationalist. Hell, for ten years between 2005-2014 when they were in power, they elected a Sikh to be their prime minister.

Sikhs manage their own temples. Punjabis in general and Sikhs in particular,  participate in Indian economy, military politics and society. Punjab - a fertile agricultural region - benefits most from India‚Äôs pro farmer laws. 

There may be problems but they don‚Äôt merit separatism. As it is, on ground, 72% of Punjabis voted in last elections. They have voted for both two major Indian parties in the past and have recently voted in a third party that‚Äôs gaining traction across north India for its anti corruption stance.

Comment,"[Look at the multiple violent insurgencies in Northeast India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurgency_in_Northeast_India), they all failed, and some of these states are majority Christian/Animist with small Hindu minorities, and are much, much more geographically, culturally, and ethnically different from other Indian states, with people of these areas being closer to the Chinese and Tibetans.

If multiple, simultaneous violent separatist uprisings that happened in far eastern majority-Christian Indian states failed, then it will not succeed in Punjab of all places - no, a sovereign state with over a billion people will never tolerate separatism and balkanization in its territory to happen, unless if this government were to suddenly collapse due to something like a nuclear war.

Redditors have a bizarre fetishization with supporting all kinds of separatist and independence movements anywhere, this is an extremely simplistic and infantile ""oppressor vs. oppressed"" thinking that completely ignores the demographics and geography of a region, real life ain't Hearts of Iron 4 where you can magically create a new country just because you want to.

Comment,">Again,  different threat perception.

I think I may agree with you here. My larger point is about how to deal with that difference in perception. First there needs to be genuine effort to come to a common understanding of the actual threat, not the perceived threat. It cannot be reduced to, ""But don't you understand?? We *feel* threatened!!""

There needs to be some work done by the parties to establish first and foremost that there is clearly adequate security being provided to any diplomatic staff. I am open to believing the Canadian government failed on this most fundamental issue because I have not heard from them in any news reports any steps that were taken to increase diplomatic security in response to Indian representations that they felt threatened.

Once there is an unmistakable commitment to the safety and security of diplomats and staff, there still needs to be engagement on how to understand the threat level. It has to be possible *in practice* to establish what constitutes a live threat versus ""normal protesters."" If there can be no such practical understanding then we are at an impasse. In any case such an impasse cannot be resolved by extra-judicial killings.",2023-10-29T23:45:49,Now_then_here_there,1,Comment,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/second-khalistan-vote-held-bc-1.7011870

To be clear, this is in [Dagestan where 83% of the population is muslim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dagestan#Religion). It's basically a mountainous border province of unhappy ethnic minorities where Russia's had recurring problems with Islamic extremism. Assuming they have the manpower, I wouldn't be surprised if they used this incident as an excuse for a fresh crackdown.

Highest profile person from Dagestan most Americans or Europeans would be familiar with is the Boston Marathon Bomber. The brothers lived there for several years as teens before their parents brought them the the US. Older brother traveled to Dagestan as an adult for his radicalization/training. He fled Russia when the FSB went about dismantling his terrorist cell, but the FBI dropped the ball on his case even though the Russians warned us about him.",2023-10-29T21:20:23,Andrew5329,6,Comment,https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-770738

Comment,"Yes, pretty much. There are a lot of events that are repeating from the 1910's - 1940 period:

- ""Spanish"" Flu / Covid
- Great Depression / Great Recession
- Large Disparities in wealth / ""ruling class""
- Many small conflicts/wars
- Rise of fascism (related to the economic downturns) / Populist ""strongman"" dictators
- Countries posturing on prior territories.
- Massive migration (related to a lot of the above)
- Trade wars leading to scarcity in some industries

Comment,"Which is precisely why Muslims/Arabs are upset about this situation - in \~1880 you had about 6% Jews and 90% Arabs in the area that would become Israel/Palestine, but with major Jewish immigration to the region (which as you mentioned were often supported by government programs) by the formal creation of Israel in '48 the balance had become about 33% Jew to 60% Arab. In that context, you can see how it would seem to Arabs that their presence there for centuries had not been properly considered and their ""claim"" to the area significantly diluted leading up to the charter. 

And to make matters worse, the '48 borders gave about 60% of the land to the Jews and 40% to Arabs, with the Jews getting arguably better quality land at that. Does that seem fair at all? I'd be pretty fucking upset about that if I were an Arab with family roots there. I think it's clear the Jewish people need and deserve a state, but the situation has been fucked from the start (probably most at fault being the British).",2023-10-29T21:46:40,krysatheo,-3,Comment,https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-770738

The images were quite disturbing with random civilians in a pool of blood dead with groceries on the ground. It caused massive outrage from the average Chinese citizen.

9/11 happens, no pogroms of Muslims despite an actual terror attack. In fact there are huge peace marches demonstrating against both the Afghan and Iraq invasion.

Comment,"Speaking as a jew, I am significantly more likely to trust Muslims good will toward me than Christians.

The extreme antisemitism were seeing in the Muslim world is actually pretty recent historically, within the last 100 years. Before that the Muslim empires were the refuge that jews fled to from Europe. The modern antisemitism in Islam is largely due to the creation of Israel as a state in what Muslim extremists see as ""their"" land, and the modern Muslim countries leaders have encouraged that antisemitism because it's politically convenient for them. 

Meanwhile the Christians murdered jews as a pass time for hundreds of years. A lot of the things that we think of as antisemitic tropes are entirely, 100% European stereotypes about Jewish people, that exist as stereotypes because of things the Europeans FORCED on Jewish people. There was not a single place in Christian Europe that did not expel or attempt to kill the jews. 

The only reason that Europe isn't just as hostile to the Jews as they were 100 years ago is because the Holocaust was so horrific to the sensibilities of post-enlightenment Christians that the governments of Europe were forced to begrudgingly accept that the jews couldn't be murdered en masse, and when some jews stayed in Europe after the Europeans tried to pressure them all to go to Israel they begrudgingly stopped the open discrimination they had previously taken part in.

Comment,"> I mean, Russians were taught in school that USSR citizens were the victims in WW2, not specifically Jews.

WWII played out somewhat differently in the USSR than in Western Europe.

For a start, [few Soviet Jews were sent to death camps](https://www.nationalww2museum.org/war/articles/ukraine-holocaust); most were instead shot in their villages.  Dead is still dead, of course, but that does mean that not only does one of the defining features of the Holocaust -- the death camps -- not really apply to the Soviet experience, it also means that the treatment and killing of Jews in the Soviet Union was *much* more similar to the treatment and killing of non-Jewish people there.

Moreover, the number of Jewish people killed in the USSR was [1.3M](https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/jewish-losses-during-the-holocaust-by-country) to [1.5M](https://www.nationalww2museum.org/war/articles/ukraine-holocaust), as compared to [14M civilian deaths](https://www.nationalww2museum.org/students-teachers/student-resources/research-starters/research-starters-worldwide-deaths-world-war) and another 10M military deaths, making the murders of Jewish people a *much* smaller share of the overall death count.  By contrast, Poland had about [3M Jews killed](https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/jewish-losses-during-the-holocaust-by-country) out of [5.6M total deaths](https://www.nationalww2museum.org/students-teachers/student-resources/research-starters/research-starters-worldwide-deaths-world-war), or 5-10x the share of deaths that the USSR saw.

Finally, it looks like a large majority of the Jewish Soviets killed in WWII were from Ukraine, and the centers of Soviet power in Russia did not always treat Ukraine and its people as equals (e.g., the [Holodomor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holodomor) where millions of Ukrainians had been starved to death not long before WWII).  That's not a good reason to discount the importance of the deaths of a group of people, obviously, but it likely played a role.

Taking those three factors together, it does not seem surprising that the Holocaust would have different cultural resonance in Russia than in Western Europe.

I don't doubt that Stalin used the opportunity to push nationalistic propaganda, and I don't doubt that antisemitism played a role, but it's not correct that every nation experienced WWII in general and the targeted murder of Jews in particular in the same way, and so I don't think it's reasonable to expect that every nation will teach about and remember either of those topics in the same way.

(For reference, the Holocaust was an atrocity, Hitler was evil, Stalin was evil, Putin is evil, Hamas is evil, and Jewish people have the same right to enjoy life as all people -- being able to understand why WWII and the Holocaust has different cultural resonance in Russia is not in any way incompatible with those points.)",2023-10-30T00:47:24,grundar,1,Comment,https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-770738

Comment,"Russia had a specific word for ""let's gather up a bunch of folk, go to the jewish area, fuck up their shit, steal some stuff, beat some folk, maybe kill a guy, really keep them on their toes"" and many languages have adopted that word because it's a specific word that wasn't present in those languages before.

It's like saying, ""Yeah, there's a reason that Schnitzel is a German word."" Doesn't mean the Germans invented the whole idea of tenderized breaded fried meat, but that it's a clear part of their zeitgeist and culture and they have a nice convenient word used in other languages now. Part of the russian culture was pogroms. It mostly stopped in the past few decades but yes Russia (and lots of eastern europe) have a deep _current_ undercurrent of blaming things on jews and calling for ye olde pogroms to come back.",2023-10-29T22:27:26,gimpwiz,1,Comment,https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-770738

Some of the people you mentioned, were simply not an important factor in Europe (who are the natives in XIV century Europe?), except for the Romani people, who are still deeply hated but who are in Europe since less time than the Jews and the hatred don't have the ""revolutionary"" aspect of antisemitism, where Jewish people are both a weak minority and the all powerful overlords. 

Unfortunately European antisemitism has had an enormous success all over the world, because Europe was powerful, so much that you can probably find random South Asian politicians knowing the Protocols of the Elder of Zion, a random fake document from early 20th century (late 19th century?

Comment,"I am not invalidating or denying that Slavic people were killed during the war. I am stating that the USSR and Stalin were specifically preventing their population from knowing that it was really the Jews that were targeted by the Holocaust.

Yes, more Slavic/USSR people died during the war, but not in the death camps. By far the majority of people in the death camps were Jewish. And the USSR was rewriting history in their favor. To this day, Russians and those who grew up in the USSR don't remember the Holocaust like the western world does.

So many left the _moment_ they could for a reason. If you look at when people were finally allowed to leave the country, starting in the 70s, who was leaving? Without having looked up statistics I'd hazard a guess that it was mostly Jews. They got robbed on their way out but still left because it was better to start over with almost nothing than stay.

In Israel, there are three languages printed on road signs: English, Arabic, and obviously Hebrew. But you can get around decently with Russian.

Comment,"She'd be thoroughly disgusted by modern Republicans. Credulous, anti-reason thugs who treat their employees like slaves and gut businesses to make themselves richer? *Those are her villains.*

It's been some time since I fully read Atlas Shrugged - Galt's speech is a goddamned doorstopper - but Hank Rearden, Dagny Taggart, Francisco D'Anconia, they're all portrayed as intimately familiar with the effort it takes to run their businesses and responsive to their employees' needs. She's also absolutely in favor of the right for employees to bargain collectively and to strike - the book was even given a working title of *The Strike* before it got its more famous name. The entire message is literally ""let the idle rich see how much money they make without people who are willing to think and work."" She actually addresses much the same conflict as Marx does, but she a) includes involved, creative owners on the side of the workers and b) obviously reaches a much different conclusion. Her philosophy is well worth reading and learning, but it takes a skilled instructor and students willing to dive into the nuance to fully appreciate.",2023-10-29T20:14:52,dancingmadkoschei,5,Comment,https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-770738

Comment,"People born in Russia grew up without freedom, individualism, and possessions.

Communism was so appealing to them because they were slaves. The Slavic Russian was still a slave up until 1906. After that he was still a slave in working camps fondly called Gulags.
 
Ayn Rand was born in 1905.

In the same vein the African American slave was still a slave 21 years after abolition (since he never grew up a free man), Ayn Rand grew up in a nation of freed slaves and by 21 ran to America.

She grew up without freedom, no wealth around (one rich man among a million poors is North Korea), no individualism as a culture and no freedom of speech. It was a girl who grew up in a nation of slaves trying to shed her childhood by adopting the values she envied. And because she was not natural born American she ended up being cartoonish in some of her ideals.",2023-10-29T21:32:35,farting_piano,1,Comment,https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-770738

But this also means that in the communist movement that became the Soviet Union, Jews made up an extremely large portion and not the old Russian elites, this is to say that Ayn Rand, who immigrated in the early years of the USSR couldn't really attribute to antisemitism but more like ""communists took my family's property and nearly starved us"" sort.",2023-10-29T18:48:38,Reof,3,Comment,https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-770738

It‚Äôs so unprecedented that some Orthodox rabbis have called Jewish assimilation in the US the Silent Holocaust since half the number of Americans that theoretically could acquire Israeli citizenship don‚Äôt identify as Jewish. There are as many quarter and half-Jewish Americans that don‚Äôt identify as there are identifying Jews. That has never before happened at such a scale.     
  
Add in that without American intervention in the World Wars and later in pushing for the establishment of a Jewish homeland in the UN, there also wouldn‚Äôt be an Israel or any European Holocaust survivors for that matter, and it makes it even greater.

When the Allies gave the modern-day land of Israel back to the Jews at the end of WWII, they were told this was going to happen. Basing your country's borders on a religious text written many thousands of years ago is guaranteed to start a fight, *especially* when you have to evict the people that had been, and are currently still, living there for thousands of years. 

The Arab-Israeli conflict has been going on for so long now that there is plenty of blame to go around, regardless of who you support. Anyone that thinks the Palestinians are blameless are just as foolish as the ones that think the Jews are blameless.

Comment,"Yes. So speaking of pogroms which exact ""society they originated within""? My point is there's a lot of baggage everywhere, but sometimes stuff happens for some other reasons than it seems.

Here's a minute of conspiracy theory from me:

Fun fact: there's a telegram channel called ""morning dagestan"" which is directly instigating shit over there. It was created as part of the [media network associated with Ilya Ponomarev](https://twitter.com/akhalchi/status/1718568869613203670) - channels starting with ""morning _location in Russia_"" with head channel called ""morning of the february"". It was created after the start of the war by a ""russian"" oppositioner Ilya Ponomarev who is living in Ukraine for the past 10 years or so and who has [Ukrainian citizenship](https://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9F%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%8C%D0%BE%D0%B2_%D0%86%D0%BB%D0%BB%D1%8F_%D0%92%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%87#%D0%9F%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%BB%D1%96%D0%B4%D1%83%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BD%D1%8F_%D0%B2_%D0%A0%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%96%D1%97). All of those channels claim their goal to be ""decolonization"" of Russia, and all of them post rather divisive stuff. It is widely speculated how this guy who was a Duma deputy during his time in Russia, has the money to finance his media network, and it is curious how this guy is portrayed in close relations to military units ""legion free Russia"" which is directly controlled by SBU.",2023-10-29T18:02:46,Igor_Kozyrev,5,Comment,https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-770738

Comment,"Yeah, nowhere was ever really awesome. That said, having talked to many people who lived both in the US and USSR through the 40s - 90s (because obviously of familial connections), those who moved to the US generally lost most of their (ancestral and personal) paranoia that they'd be targeted by the government and/or neighbors any day, because after decades of being treated _mostly_ fine the fears sort of atrophied. Of course, most who moved to the US ended up in the northeast (especially NYC, CT, Boston, etc), some in California (which is not nearly as welcoming). Generally they had the good sense to avoid KKK-burg. I mean yeah the KKK did operate in the northeast too, but it never had the sort of power there as it did in much of the south and midwest.

I guess if I really had a point to make, which I don't, it would be that the US may not have been entirely welcoming to jews post-WW2, but US federal policy was adequately welcoming, several states and especially several metropolitan areas were pretty welcoming, and the shame and guilt of knowing about the holocaust kept most mildly-intolerant people mostly-adequately-civil in those areas, and their grandkids today didn't inherit much of the distrust or hate. On the flip side, the USSR softened its stance _somewhat_ but not much, disappearances in the night were still too common for decades after WW2, options for jews were always limited, official policy was to keep jews down, opportunity was scarce, and anti-jewish sentiment was always used as a crutch by various leaders whenever they needed a scapegoat, and neighbors could only occasionally be counted on when things got hairy.",2023-10-29T22:46:45,gimpwiz,2,Comment,https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-770738
Comment,"Russian Empire wasn't a democracy. Russians were restricted in movement, just like Jews were. The empire was ruled until 1796 by Catherine the Great, born Princess Sophie of Anhalt-Zerbst of the ruling German family of Anhalt, married to Peter III of Russia at the age of fifteen. Peter was born Charles Peter Ulrich of Schleswig-Holstein-Gottorp, barely spoke Russian, and was overthrown by Catherine after half a year or his rule.

The Pale of Settlement was established in 1791 with the Second Partition of Poland, when eastern parts of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth were annexed by the Russian Empire with their population, including Jews. Consequently, the Pale included little of what can be called Russia.

P.S. In fact, Jews were forbidden to live in agricultural communities at least at the establishment of the Pale. Perhaps this was relaxed by 1905, but idk if this particular aspect of ‚ÄòFiddler on the Roof‚Äô really squares with reality.",2023-10-30T00:44:51,LickingSmegma,1,Comment,https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-770738

Comment,"Ok, look, its very simple. 

The moment they activated the LHC in our origination universe, a quantum cataclysm occured that results in OUR universe being shifted into another universe. 

Imagine a clear piece of paper with a design drawn on it, being overlaid on TOP of antother piece of paper with a very simiar, not-quite-the-same design on top of it. 

We're the transparent pattern in this scenario. 

Because we're no longer in our own universe, the contextual threads of history are different. 

The LHC in THIS universe did not produce a quantum cataclysm, which is why this universe didn't shift, but was instead merged. 

If you look up anything about the LHC, all the records you will find about it are records about the LHC is this NEW universe, NOT the details of the LHC in our origination universe. 

Overall, to a layperson, the machine might LOOK the same. But key details diverge. It's design is different in several notable ways. The scientists and engineers working on it are not the same people, in many cases. I do not know the total shape of the degrees of separation, I can only say based on the math that it would have been similar but different in notable ways.

While they are similar, they are obviously different in details significant enough for one to have caused the Event, but not the other one.

If you actually start to really break down the math, this becomes exceedingly obvious to any observer, which is how me and a few colleagues have become aware of what transpired, and are working both to raise people's awareness, and also to build a solution to reverse what has been done, which we are certain CAN be done, but only with enough public awareness adn support.",2023-10-29T20:32:40,TheBirminghamBear,7,Comment,https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-770738

Here's the Wiki map of countries by penalty for ""apostasy"":

https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9b/Apostasy_laws_world_map.svg

and here's a map of countries by % Muslim population:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_world#/media/File:Islam_percent_population_in_each_nation_World_Map_Muslim_data_by_Pew_Research.svg

Note all of the dark green (majority Muslim) countries where this is not the case.  They have enough power and are immune enough from Western pressure.  Why not there?

What you're doing is oversimplifying all the different branches of Islam into a single narrative of punitive, theocratic Islamism.  Even in the countries where this is the case, this doesn't represent *all* Muslims, that represents the ruling authorities.  Note Iran, for example, where officially there is the death penalty for ""apostasy"", but the population increasingly is trying to shrug off their autocratic/theocratic government entirely.  An increasingly Western country by most standards, by the way, until the CIA completely destabilized it in the early 1950s with a coup, triggering a death spiral towards totalitarian Islamism based on a narrative of ""Muslims vs. The West"" (over their attempts to nationalize the oil industry away from BP's control, as I understand it).  Just like there's Protestant Christianity, which at different times was punishable by the death penalty, but isn't today, people are capable of partially following some lessons from Islam and ignoring the theocratic and draconian legal codes.

One of the key points here is that theocratic policies achieve a lot of success among poor and uneducated populaces, especially if they've experienced some kind of repression or official discrimination.  The same conditions that spawned the Crusades, the Inquisition, the Salem Witch Trials, or whatever other Christian atrocities in the past - or today, how fascist-leaning evangelical Christians from poor and uneducated areas in the U.S. are drawn to religious policies.

And by the way, read Leviticus sometime.  That stuff's still technically at the core of Judaism and Christianity, depending on who you ask, and it's pretty out there in terms of draconian penalties.  But that says absolutely nothing about the mindset and behavior of every single person worldwide identifying as Christian or Jewish.",2023-10-29T22:24:47,interesta,2,Comment,https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-770738

All religions have a fundamental problem in that a rigid moral code, especially one pitched towards sanctifying the religion while condemning all other ways of looking at reality (a commonality to all Abrahamic religious texts - read Leviticus some time), is going to have harmful consequences compared to a scientific ethical approach based on the actual effects actions have on other people.

Comment,"I can't find a source for that after a cursory look, but I believe you if you say there were crimes committed against the Armenians. My point stands though even if there was/is recurring violence in a country. There were large amounts of Jewish progroms in Russia and post communist takeover they largely went away/were diminished. And to say Russia has always been this way I think is both a disservice to the many victims of the progroms as well as the many Russians and Jews that did fight to change the power structures of Tsarist Russia. Here is Lenin's speech on progroms:

""Anti-Semitism means spreading enmity towards the Jews. When the accursed tsarist monarchy was living its last days it tried to incite ignorant workers and peasants against the Jews. The tsarist police, in alliance with the landowners and the capitalists, organised pogroms against the Jews. The landowners and capitalists tried to divert the hatred of the workers and peasants who were tortured by want against the Jews. In other countries, too, we often see the capitalists fomenting hatred against the Jews in order to blind the workers, to divert their attention from the real enemy of the working people, capital. Hatred towards the Jews persists only in those countries where slavery to the landowners and capitalists has created abysmal ignorance among the workers and peasants. Only the most ignorant and downtrodden people can believe the lies and slander that are spread about the Jews. This is a survival of ancient feudal times, when the priests burned heretics at the stake, when the peasants lived in slavery, and when the people were crushed and inarticulate. This ancient, feudal ignorance is passing away; the eyes of the people are being opened.""",2023-10-29T22:46:14,rsoto2,1,Comment,https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-770738

Comment,"[Here is the RSF analysis](https://rsf.org/en/rsf-video-investigation-death-reuters-reporter-issam-abdallah-lebanon-journalists-vehicle-was). Key points on mental state are as follows:

> Two strikes in the same place in such a short space of time (just over 30 seconds), from the same direction, clearly indicate precise targeting.

> It is unlikely that the journalists were mistaken for combatants, especially as they were not hiding: in order to have a clear field of vision, they had been in the open for more than an hour, on the top of a hill. They were wearing helmets and bullet-proof waistcoats marked ""press"". Their car was also identified as ""press"" thanks to a marking on the roof, according to witnesses. 

> At around 4.45pm, one of the Al Jazeera journalists interviewed in the video spotted an Israeli helicopter flying over the area and was able to spot the journalists. The reporters were therefore identified in the area by the forces present before the bombing.

Obviously it was targeting, that doesnt mean it was targeting of journalists intentionally

It would be pretty weird for actual combatants to stand around doing nothing ""in the open for more than an hour, on the top of a hill"". And they were clearly marked.

Still I actually agree there's reasonable space for different interpretations of the events and a mistake is entirely plausible; the main issue is that the IDF has form with killing journalists (accidentally or otherwise) and lying about it.

The US government changed their long standing position of not negotiating with terrorists to be able to pay them a ransom. The terrorists did not give back the hostages. Thai authorities would not allow US special forces to rescue. They opted to do it on their own after the couple had been hostage for over a year.

Comment,"From a ""Hamas calls everything a war crime, is this actually a war crime?"" standpoint, it's not a war crime for IDF to blow up hospitals filled with active Hamas, even if there are civilians, too.  The standard is ""disproportionate"" civilian casualties compared to the military objective, which is an intentionally vague standard.

From a ""isn't it morally better if more IDF soldiers get killed in a ground invasion instead of bombing hospitals?"" standpoint, the answer is still no.  If Hamas is in/under the hospital, then that's where the fighting is going to be.  Civilians will still be killed in the crossfire either way. Since Hamas is actively preventing evacuation, there's no reason to assume fewer civilians will die later rather than sooner.  Thinking more IDF casualties=more moral outcome means that the value of IDF lives is less than 0.  The most moral outcome here is either Hamas surrenders peacefully (not happening) or allows the civilians to evacuate before battle to save their lives (also not happening).",2023-10-29T20:14:53,Mobile-Entertainer60,8,Comment,https://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2023/10/29/idf-bombs-al-quds-hospital-refute-claims-hamas/8771698601119/
Comment,"I saw someone post the actual laws governing war crimes and if you use civilian places for military purposes, it's a military target, and only a war crime if the civilian losses are 'unreasonable' (don't remember the exact lawyer lingo). To find the exact threshold you will probably have to ask an expert. 
   
There was even a special clause for hospitals, so on top of the above you also have to give warnings ahead of the attack.     
      
But generally, it's not a crime to attack civilian targets if they are used for military purposes, even if it means civilian losses.    
     
I think the point of the laws is to make it so that human shields *don't work*, which means there's no point in doing it. You gain no security and you only incur more civilian losses.

I assure you, if Israel wanted to maximize damage, 50,000 plus would be dead simply by directing all those missiles at more vulnerable targets.",2023-10-29T15:11:09,SparseSpartan,44,Comment,https://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2023/10/29/idf-bombs-al-quds-hospital-refute-claims-hamas/8771698601119/
Comment,"I remember when we (the united states) bombed weddings when we were looking for terrorists. Not okay, regardless of hiw you feel. If I was forced to pick an option between sending soldiers in to accomplish a mission their state decided it wanted over bombing and killing innocent civilians guess what? I choose sending your fucking soldiers in. 

But really, none of this should be happening anyways but both sides are controlled hateful racists.",2023-10-29T20:08:52,bitterless,-2,Comment,https://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2023/10/29/idf-bombs-al-quds-hospital-refute-claims-hamas/8771698601119/

Comment,"That‚Äôs the claim of the army killing those children.

There‚Äôs now way they have enough secret intel to destroy over 17,000 housing units in 14 days.
It makes no sense.

Comment,"Sure if that would work, then wonderful. But sending soldiers into hostile urban territory is a surefire way to end up with a lot of dead soldiers and nothing to show for it, and probably a hell of a lot more dead civilians when the war stretches on indefinitely because you are going to create another Vietnam type situation.",2023-10-29T21:21:47,saranowitz,4,Comment,https://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2023/10/29/idf-bombs-al-quds-hospital-refute-claims-hamas/8771698601119/
Comment,"You‚Äôre also forgetting the the soldiers you send in aren‚Äôt faceless drones - you are beholden to your people, to whom those soldiers are sons and daughters, friends and family. 

Your first responsibility as a military leader is to achieve victory, your second is to minimize your own casualties, and your third to minimize collateral damage. In that order. 

Would that it wasn‚Äôt so, but war is a bitter thing. These are the priorities.",2023-10-29T22:29:19,Doplgangr,4,Comment,https://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2023/10/29/idf-bombs-al-quds-hospital-refute-claims-hamas/8771698601119/
