Comment,"Al-Shifa is a goal for the on-land invasion. It is a huge military target, with a base underneath it. This is fucking tragic and is exactly why embedding in civilian architecture is a fucking WAR CRIME. 

If Hamas didn’t roam the halls in 2008 [murdering “Israeli collaborators”](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Shifa_Hospital) I’d be furious that they didn’t have a full triage unit securing the hospital themselves to administer aid.

Netanyahu indicates Israel will oppose Palestinian Authority’s return to Gaza after war,,2023-11-11T17:50:42,Super_Camel_3254,883,483,https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/netanyahu-suggests-israel-to-oppose-palestinian-authoritys-return-to-gaza-after-war/
Comment,"As an Israeli I have to say that we also don't have a clue what he is planning to do...

All we know is that he is telling each media what the audience wants to hear.

To the far right he spoke of the return to settle gaza, to  fox news he told that he is planning to reinstate the Palestinian authority in the Gaza strip and yesterday he told the heads of the villages near gaza that Israel will oversee the security in the gaza strip from now on...

So from my heart I can tell you that he is 100% committed to save his own hide. I encourage you to listen to the idf spoker as he reports directly from the security cabinet, but take netanyahu's words with a large grain of salt. 

After we are done with hamas, we will deal with him.

Comment,"I'm an American.  I strongly support the US sending in our ships to dissuade other nations from interfering, continuing to provide Isreal with military equipment and aid, and using its slightly larger profile to assist with strikes against the Hamas leadership structure outside of Gaza.

However as a liberal and a human being, I despise Netanyahu and the majority of the conservative parties in Isreal, and think some of the extreme rhetoric and strategies employed in the occupied territories are crimes against humanity, on par with how many Western nations treated indigenous peoples over the centuries.  I had hoped before all this, Netanyahu was going to go down for the well-documented fraud and corruption, now it seems he's untouchable.

I'm also not sure it's accurate to say 'martyrs' are paid per number murdered. The PA pays based on length of prison sentence, so I suppose the logic is that more people killed = longer prison sentence = more the PA pays the prisoner. Clearly still not a good thing though, when no distinction is made between someone who was imprisoned or died for Palestine and someone who committed an act of terror against innocent civilians in the name of Palestine.

Comment,"I don't think Netanyahu seeks a 'pragmatic solution'.

To try and speak dis-passionately for a moment, I don't think there is a solution for the Palestinian issue from here that improves Israel position, short of ethnic cleansing.  Israel, I think, has maximized it's outcomes and now enjoys significant leverage.  But that position has engendered violence, and allowed Israel opponents in Iran to fund ultra-violent groups to exist in that space.

And attempt to de-escalate or reduce violence in the long term, in my opinion either has to begin walking away from the maximization of Israeli outcomes either by pursuing a one or two state solution, or proceed towards pushing the Palestinians out of Palestine in order to secure it's borders.

Netanyahu's position is a reflection of that dichotomy, I feel.  He can't admit that their only way forward is more violence, but he has no choice but to either continue violence or concede to de-escalation in some way, and his political position has always been that de-escalation, or a solution is unacceptable to Israeli security.",2023-11-11T21:33:52,N3bu89,1,Comment,https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/netanyahu-suggests-israel-to-oppose-palestinian-authoritys-return-to-gaza-after-war/

Comment,"If you read up on the news in Israel recently, the people have been fighting really hard to take Netanyahu out and hold him accountable for his many literal crimes. The trouble is that Netanyahu isn't elected directly like the president would be in America--people vote for parties, and those parties are allocated seats at the Knesset based on percentage of people that voted for them, and those parties then have to get a majority together to pick the Prime Minister. Right now, there are enough parties who combined make a majority and they all think Netanyahu is better for their purposes for one reason or another. To get him out, the balance of power needs to shift in the Knesset, and that can be hard if other parties don't have enough in common to make a shared government (for example, two parties may want peace with Palestine, but one wants gay people to be married and religion to have diminished influence in government and the other wants sodomy to be illegal and religion to have a greater influence on government). 

This isn't per se about Israelis liking Netanyahu. This is about a system that is broken--and honestly a lot of us come from countries with fundamentally broken political systems.",2023-11-11T21:19:31,RoofClinger,1,Comment,https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/netanyahu-suggests-israel-to-oppose-palestinian-authoritys-return-to-gaza-after-war/
Comment,"Ideally? Yes. Unfortunately it's not common knowledge that idf and the Palestain authority have some extremely close relationships. Most of the peace keeping action in the west bank is done by the Palestain authority. So yeah, we can and have been working with them for a while all in order to keep the peace.

But a big problem is that it is also not talked about in any news outside of israeli media, is that the people of gaza hate the Palestinian authority and likewise.

The people of gaza were under Egyptian rule up until 67 and those in the west bank were Jordanian. They are not close for at least 3 generations.

Here is a personal story of mine, you can read it if you want.

When I served in the west bank, there was a friendly Palestinian farmer who worked in Israel and would sit and talk with me and my soldiers at the crossing point every other day. When one day I asked him the same question you asked me here about the people of gaza he laughed at me. He said that they are not in touch in years, he called them crazy and radical, he said that the Palestinians in the west bank are afraid of them. And i can't blame him, in 2006 after hamas was democratically elected in Gaza, they slaughtered hundreds of members of the Palestain authority( including some family members of the farmer).

In short, yes you are right, the PA is much better than hamas. But the citizens of gaza will not accept them and we will likely witness them killing each other yet again.

It's an idea, but I'm not so sure how practical it is... Much rather coalition group of US, Germany, UK etc... will come and try to rebuild gaza just like Berlin after WW2...",2023-11-11T20:58:11,Mugi101,1,Comment,https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/netanyahu-suggests-israel-to-oppose-palestinian-authoritys-return-to-gaza-after-war/

Yes it's fucked up.

For the last year half of Israel was out on the streets for a reason, I believe that after the war the scales will be way more in our favor. A lots of his ""base"" are the people in the south of Israel( so they suffer in particular), they are looking for strength and netanyahu is looking weak.

Comment,"That isn't the case here.

Israelis are relatively united in prosecuting a counter-invasion, destroying Hamas's warmaking capability, and hopefully rescuing as many hostages as possible, but the polling for Netanyahu has soured. Israelis are broadly blaming Netanyahu for the myriad ways in which his policies led to Hamas's October 7th invasion of souther Israel.

[The polling reflects this:](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/poll-80-of-israelis-say-netanyahu-must-publicly-take-responsibility-for-oct-7-failures/) 80% of Israelis said in mid-late October that it's *Netanyahu* who should take responsibility for the security failures, including 69% of Israelis who'd voted for Netanyahu's Likud party.

Make no mistake: Israelis may be fairly united about fighting Hamas, but the vast majority blame Netanyahu for the security failures.

Comment,"This is the exact strategy Israel uses to justify their military actions.

Israel published 3D animation showing a Hamas HQ under Gaza’s largest hospital and people accepted that as proof despite it just being an animation. They showed a photo of fuel tanks in a random field with no indication of how much fuel they had and said it was proof of Hamas hoarding fuel. They have provided zero evidence that Hamas is using human shield, but because they have done it in the past they don’t need proof.

And on the other side…

Egypt and US confirmed that Israel was warned about an attack but because there isn’t a piece of paper that says “we knew” nobody cares. Israelis claimed the IDF shelled the Kibbutz and killed Israelis on 10/7 but since there’s no video, nobody cares. Israel tweeted a plan with an option to relocate Gazans to the Sinai but because that option wasn’t circled in bright red ink nobody cares. Israel fired a mortar at journalists in Lebanon after they sent their coordinates to IDF but because there isn’t a phone recording of them saying “kill those guys” they say it’s an accident and nobody cares.

Israel’s accusations require lowest burden of proof. Accusations against Israel demand the highest burden of proof.

If they wanted to disprove/prove their claims, they could publish their actual communications or actual evidence. Until they do it’s only common sense to assume the reason they don’t is because they’re lying. This is exactly why people are becoming less trusting of Israel’s government. You can only say, “just trust us” for so long.",2023-11-11T21:25:53,kieranjackwilson,1,Comment,https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/netanyahu-suggests-israel-to-oppose-palestinian-authoritys-return-to-gaza-after-war/

Comment,"No western liberal, worth their latte, should believe for a moment that most Palestinian Muslims hold any tolerant views of LGBTQ+ or women’s rights, if that’s what you’re getting at. But the same can be said of many Jewish traditions in Israel.

Bad, disturbed and predatory people exist everywhere. Under every government, culture, religion and profession. Israel isn’t short on its own history of terrorism or terrorist groups. 

The wall you’re hitting with some is maybe some of your loose language that suggests a distinction doesn’t exist between say Hamas and all Palestinians. Think we can all agree that a Palestinian 10 year old or infant isn’t responsible for any of this shit. There are also many Palestinian mothers, fathers and grandparents that aren’t responsible for this and just do what they need to do to get by in Gaza (since most can’t go anywhere else), provide for their families and survive. 

Not every Palestinian supports Hamas or the evil they represent. Not even every Palestinian that may say they do. Some just say so to survive.

Destroy Hamas root and branch. Yes. Mourn the deaths of both civilian Palestinians and Israelis and push for practices, by both sides, that minimize these losses. Also, yes.

Comment,"Indeed, Israel has made some pretty decent attempts at making peace but the Palestinians would have none of it.

For example, in 2008:

Olmert (Prime Minister of Israel) had offered a near-total withdrawal from the West Bank, proposing that Israel retain 6.3% of the territory in order to keep control of major Jewish settlements. He said he offered to compensate the Palestinians with Israeli land equivalent to 5.8% of the West Bank, along with a land link to the Gaza Strip — another territory meant to be part of a future Palestinian state.

Olmert was also prepared to divide Jerusalem into two Israeli- and Palestinian-controlled cities, and to relinquish Israeli sovereignty over the Temple Mount and the entire Old City. He proposed that the “Holy Basin” be overseen instead by a five-member, non-sovereign international trusteeship, comprising Israel, the PA, Jordan, the US and Saudi Arabia.

Comment,"What they mean...

> The geology team discovered in March that melted plastic had become intertwined with the rocks on the volcanic island, forming what they call “plastiglomerates.” By definition, a plastiglomerate is made up of rock fragments, sand grains, debris, and other organic materials welded together with once-molten plastic.

> “The pollution, the garbage in the sea, and plastic dumped incorrectly in the oceans is becoming geological material … preserved in the earth’s geological records,” Fernanda Avelar Santos, a geologist at the Federal University of Parana, told Reuters.

> The plastic rocks were found on a part of Trindade Island that is permanently preserved for green turtles to lay their eggs. In fact, the only inhabitants of the island are members of the Brazilian Navy, specifically there to protect the nesting turtles.

> “We identified [the pollution] mainly comes from fishing nets, which is very common debris on Trindade Island’s beaches,” Santos told Reuters. “When the temperature rises, this plastic melts and becomes embedded with the beach’s natural material.”

> Fishing nets and other gear pose a huge threat to marine wildlife and the ocean’s ecosystem.

Comment,"This brings to mind a book by David McCauley called Motel of the Mysteries, In which modern civilization of the 20th century collapsed after all the air pollution precipitated out abruptly, burying everything. 

The book describes the amazing discoveries made by an archaeologist excavating a new site showing the amazing artifacts of the past civilization.

https://www.amazon.com/Motel-Mysteries-David-Macaulay-ebook/dp/B003SNKBQE

>It is the year 4022, and the entire ancient country of Usa has been buried under many feet of detritus from a catastrophe that occurred back in 1985. Howard Carson, an amateur archeologist, is crossing the perimeter of an abandoned excavation site when he feels the ground give way beneath him. Suddenly, he finds himself at the bottom of a shaft, which, judging from the DO NOT DISTURB sign hanging from an archaic doorknob, is clearly the entrance to a still-sealed burial chamber.
 
>Carson's incredible discoveries, including the remains of two bodies, one laid to rest on a ceremonial bed facing an altar that appeared to be a means of communicating with the Gods and the other lying in a porcelain sarcophagus in the Inner Chamber. These dramatic discoveries give Carson all the clues he needs to piece together the entire civilization—which he gets utterly wrong.

Comment,"I took a seminar on the archaeology of religion and I often pushed back against the dominant narratives of “This must be a temple” with epistemological points about how, without textual evidence, it’s essentially unknowable and we ought to approach sites with a more open mind, never mind the uselessness of noting X to be of ‘religious significance’ in cultures that were thoroughly saturated in religious aspects at every cultural level (Greece, Rome, Canaan, &c.). E.g., we bless someone when they sneeze, but it isn’t per se a deeply religious action to do so despite the history of this gesture.

> It is said that Ukrainian sources recently passed on Roman Chervynskyi's name and the suspicion of his involvement in the crime to other intelligence services. Behind closed doors in Kyiv, his name is now frequently mentioned.

Comment,"> Roman Chervinsky, a colonel in Ukraine’s Special Operations Forces, was integral to the brazen sabotage operation, say people familiar with planning


> A senior Ukrainian military officer with deep ties to the country’s intelligence services played a central role in the bombing of the Nord Stream natural gas pipeline last year, according to officials in Ukraine and elsewhere in Europe, as well as other people knowledgeable about the details of the covert operation.


> The officer’s role provides the most direct evidence to date tying Ukraine’s military and security leadership to a controversial act of sabotage that has spawned multiple criminal investigations and that U.S. and Western officials have called a dangerous attack on Europe’s energy infrastructure.


> Roman Chervinsky, a decorated 48-year-old colonel who served in Ukraine’s Special Operations Forces, was the “coordinator” of the Nord Stream operation, people familiar with his role said, managing logistics and support for a six-person team that rented a sailboat under false identities and used deep-sea diving equipment to place explosive charges on the gas pipelines. On Sept. 26, 2022, three explosions caused massive leaks on the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines, which run from Russia to Germany under the Baltic Sea. The attack left only one of the four gas links in the network intact as winter approached.


> Chervinsky did not act alone and he did not plan the operation, according to the people familiar with his role, which has not been previously reported. The officer took orders from more senior Ukrainian officials, who ultimately reported to Gen. Valery Zaluzhny, Ukraine’s highest-ranking military officer, said people familiar with how the operation was carried out. They spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive details about the bombing, which has strained diplomatic relations with Ukraine and drawn objections from U.S. officials.",2023-11-11T17:09:42,UltimateShipTheThird,0,Comment,https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/11/11/nordstream-bombing-ukraine-chervinsky/

Comment,"A ceasefire (assuming all the 239 hostages are returned safe and sound) would not be the end of hunting Hamas. A limited ceasefire in southern Gaza, lasting a few days could be agreed upon, because it would be worth it for the families of the hostages and a chance for Israel to heal. After the ceasefire Nili, Mossad and the IDF could continue their work.

Btw the ceasefire would probably not last more than a few hours anyway because Hamas would want to take advantage of the situation and start shooting at Israel again. In the terms of the ceasefire US, UK and France could be observers and any sign of Hamas attacking anyone would make the ceasefire null and void, with the responsibility falling entirely on Hamas.",2023-11-11T16:23:52,Puzzleheaded-Rub-396,22,Comment,https://saudigazette.com.sa/article/637622/SAUDI-ARABIA/FMs-of-Arab-Islamic-countries-assigned-to-create-an-international-pressure-to-stop-the-war-on-Gaza

Unfortunately, this time things are different. 10/7 was much more catastrophic than previous attacks, and rockets from Gaza, Lebanon, and Yemen are overwhelming the Iron Dome system, resulting in 60 additional Israeli deaths so far. Israel has to disrupt or destroy rocket launch and manufacture sites in Gaza and Lebanon, and Hamas military infrastructure in Gaza in order to maintain national security.

Comment,"It is not. It is a war crime to use human shields. The combatant using human shields then loses all protection given through the Geneva Convention.

>International humanitarian law permits members of the armed forces of a State party to an international armed conflict and associated militias who fulfill the requisite criteria to directly engage in hostilities. They are generally considered lawful, or privileged, combatants who may not be prosecuted for the taking part in hostilities as long as they respect international humanitarian law. Upon capture they are entitled to prisoner of war status.  
If civilians directly engage in hostilities, they are considered "" unlawful "" or "" unprivileged "" combatants or belligerents (the treaties of humanitarian law do not expressly contain these terms). They may be prosecuted under the domestic law of the detaining state for such action.  
Both lawful and unlawful combatants may be interned in wartime, may be interrogated and may be prosecuted for war crimes. Both are entitled to humane treatment in the hands of the enemy.

>The principle of proportionality requires parties to balance military advantage against the risk of harm to civilians and civilian objects.

Using human shields can be seen as an harmful act towards the enemy. Thus the civilian protection is gone. You are not allowed to use human shields whether they are there voluntarily or not.

Comment,"Keeping people impoverished is part of how they hold on to power. As one of the tunnel diggers told Vice, he wouldn’t be doing dangerous and hard work for $10 a day if he had another choice. It’s the same thing for the Pay-For-Slay programs that promise pensions to your family if you blow yourself up or die stabbing Jewish civilians. 

That’s why the Israeli government had a strategy of offering more work permits, allowing Palestinians to cross the boarder where jobs pay more. Unfortunately a number of these people were killed by Hamas for fraternizing with Israel.  Of course the war shut down the boarder so those people can’t commute anymore. Also it seems some of these people provided intel to Hamas that aided the 10/7 attacks so many Israelis feel the risks are too high for the program to continue.",2023-11-11T18:57:42,OlynykDidntFoulLove,37,Comment,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-11-11/pro-palestinian-rally-port-botany-blockade-israeli-ship/103093816

Comment,"Cyberattacks against private companies ain't treason.

It's.....all kinds of illegal, depending on what exactly entailed in the 'cyberattack' (DDoS, stealing of IP, privacy violations, etc.) which can get you a *nasty* prison sentence and/or fine, but it really isn't treason (unless you hack a private company and use THAT to directly attack the government in some way that violates laws directly relating to treason).

Comment,"> That’s why the Israeli government had a strategy of offering more work permits, allowing Palestinians to cross the boarder where jobs pay more. Unfortunately a number of these people were killed by Hamas for fraternizing with Israel. Of course the war shut down the boarder so those people can’t commute anymore. Also it seems some of these people provided intel to Hamas that aided the 10/7 attacks so many Israelis feel the risks are too high for the program to continue.

What grinds my gears is when misinformed people, many who are now insisting on humanitarian aid to Gaza, are loudly proclaiming that these work permits and money transfers that Bibi allowed starting in ~2018 were ""Bibi deliberately funding Hamas"". What do they think humanitarian aid to Gaza means? The people who didn't want more of these permits at the time were far-right members of the Israeli government.

It makes more sense as a slightly cynical political attack after the Oct 7 attacks destroyed all political will to work with Gazans in Israel, and I'm not going to judge their politicians for bringing it up to try to drum up opposition to Bibi as I'm not a fan of him anyway, but the people outside Israel who make the claim without understanding the context have no idea that they are now essentially regurgitating far-right talking points in order to get rid of Bibi, which... given the subject, very ironic.",2023-11-11T21:11:33,rukqoa,1,Comment,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-11-11/pro-palestinian-rally-port-botany-blockade-israeli-ship/103093816

Comment,"Perhaps country is the wrong term. [In modern times, the area was ruled by the Ottoman Empire, then the British Empire and since 1948 it has been divided into Israel, the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Palestine)

I don’t know what the technical term would be, but if you look at a map pre-1948 there is a “region” named Palestine where Israel stands today that was under England control. Maybe colony is the best way to describe it. Following the creation of Israel in 1948 by the UN there was [war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War) over the land that was taken, and there’s been fighting ever since.

[During World War I the British government issued the Balfour Declaration, favoring the establishment of a national home for the Jewish people in Palestine. The British captured Palestine from the Ottomans shortly thereafter. The League of Nations gave Britain mandatory power over Palestine in 1922. British colonial rule and Arab efforts to prevent Jewish migration into Palestine led to growing sectarian violence between Arabs and Jews, eventually causing the British government to announce its intention to terminate the Mandate in 1947. The United Nations General Assembly recommended partitioning Palestine into two states; one Arab and one Jewish. However, the situation in Palestine had deteriorated into a civil war between Arabs and Jews. The Arabs rejected the Partition Plan, the Jews ostensibly accepted it, declaring the independence of the State of Israel in May 1948 upon the termination of the British mandate.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Palestine)",2023-11-11T19:45:48,cinnamontoasst,-7,Comment,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-11-11/pro-palestinian-rally-port-botany-blockade-israeli-ship/103093816

Comment,"Yes.

And how is the area that was in the partition map that became Israel ""taken"" from anybody?

If it was controlled by the British, and they partitioned it into two sections, based on majority population centers and **land ownership**, how is it that the Arabs believe it was ""taken"" from them?

There's plenty of Arab Israeli's who live peacefully, own property, etc. in Israel.

The only reason Arabs living in the Israel partition lost their homes is because they left them voluntarily so the Arab nations could destroy the nascent nation of Israel without them being in the way.

It didn't work out for them they way they hoped.",2023-11-11T19:52:10,Schnort,7,Comment,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-11-11/pro-palestinian-rally-port-botany-blockade-israeli-ship/103093816

Comment,">  land that was previously Palestinian 

You keep asserting that.   It is not true.

Palestinians never governed the land.  Most of the land that went into Israel was literally owned by Jews as individuals, or foundations created to purchase land for Jews.  

The land was divided into two governing entities by the British, based on demographics that included land ownership and occupation.   

So, again, how was it ""taken"" from Palestinians if they didn't own it and didn't govern it?",2023-11-11T20:10:13,Schnort,4,Comment,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-11-11/pro-palestinian-rally-port-botany-blockade-israeli-ship/103093816

Comment,"**From Shane Harris and Isabelle Khurshudyan:**

A senior Ukrainian military officer with deep ties to the country’s intelligence services played a central role in the bombing of the Nord Stream natural gas pipeline last year, according to officials in Ukraine and elsewhere in Europe, as well as other people knowledgeable about the details of the covert operation.

The officer’s role provides the most direct evidence to date tying Ukraine’s military and security leadership to a controversial act of sabotage that has spawned multiple criminal investigations and that U.S. and Western officials have called a dangerous attack on Europe’s energy infrastructure.

Roman Chervinsky, a decorated 48-year-old colonel who served in Ukraine’s Special Operations Forces, was the “coordinator” of the Nord Stream operation, people familiar with his role said, managing logistics and support for a six-person team that rented a sailboat under false identities and used deep-sea diving equipment to place explosive charges on the gas pipelines. On Sept. 26, 2022, three explosions caused massive leaks on the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines, which run from Russia to Germany under the Baltic Sea. The attack left only one of the four gas links in the network intact as winter approached.

Chervinsky did not act alone and he did not plan the operation, according to the people familiar with his role, which has not been previously reported. The officer took orders from more senior Ukrainian officials, who ultimately reported to Gen. Valery Zaluzhny, Ukraine’s highest-ranking military officer, said people familiar with how the operation was carried out. They spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive details about the bombing, which has strained diplomatic relations with Ukraine and drawn objections from U.S. officials.

Ukraine has launched many daring and secretive operations against Russian forces. But the Nord Stream attack targeted civilian infrastructure built to provide energy to millions of people in Europe. While Gazprom, the Russian state-owned gas conglomerate, owns 51 percent of Nord Stream, Western energy companies, including from Germany, France and the Netherlands, are partners and invested billions in the project. Ukraine had long complained that Nord Stream would allow Russia to bypass Ukrainian pipes, depriving Kyiv of huge transit revenue.

Comment,"We’ve known for awhile the operation was conductive by Ukrainian citizens, but I guess this confirms it was an official act of Ukraine and not Russia using Ukrainian citizens to attack the pipeline.

Comment,"Anders Puck Nielsen is a ""Military analyst at the Royal Danish Defence College with a specialty in Russia, the war in Ukraine, and military command."" 

In his video, [Nord Stream sabotage and hybrid war on Europe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk-0qJXyido), he makes an argument, based on his own understanding of military strategy, that Russia did the attack. 

> Analysis of the Nord Stream pipeline sabotage. I use Kilcullen's theory about liminal warfare and prospect theory to analyse the operational design. 
This shows that Russia is the most likely suspect, because all other actors would have made different operational choices.

The argument is fairly convincing, but it was always presented as an argument, and he makes it clear in the video that (at the time) there was no evidence for anything.

The video was posted a year ago, when it happened, and obviously hasn't taken into account any new information since then.",2023-11-11T19:12:27,Druggedhippo,4,Comment,https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/11/11/nordstream-bombing-ukraine-chervinsky/?utm_campaign=wp_main&utm_medium=social&utm_source=reddit.com

Comment,"The original report was published as a  cooperation between German state owned ZDF and Der Spiegel, a German newspaper with a reputation for uncovering government corruption. Since the Spiegel article is behind a paywall, here the Zeit article (Germany's most reputable newspaper) citing it and it's own previous reports. Because its in German, I will add a translation.

https://www.zeit.de/politik/ausland/2023-08/nord-stream-sabotage-ukraine-turkstream

> Saboteurs of Nord Stream pipeline reportedly fled to Ukraine

>The Nord Stream saboteurs were in Ukraine before and after the attack, according to a report. Ukrainian forces were also planning to attack another pipeline. According to media reports, the investigations into the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines have yielded another lead into Ukraine. Numerous traces of data indicated that the saboteurs fled to Ukraine after the attack almost a year ago, reports Spiegel and ZDF. **After analyzing IP addresses and other data, investigators from the Federal Criminal Police Office and the Federal Police came to the conclusion that the suspects were in Ukraine before and after the sabotage and communicated from there. The data evaluation gave a fairly clear picture in this regard, reports Der Spiegel, citing security circles.**

>Investigators apparently assume Ukrainian saboteurs

>**According to the reports, the suspicion that a Ukrainian commando was responsible for the attack now predominates among the investigators.** One knows far more than is publicly known, Der Spiegel quotes an unnamed top official as saying. However, there are no indications of a Russian operation. According to Spiegel, it is still unclear whether government agencies were aware of the plans. However, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was not involved. In recent months there have been growing indications that Ukrainian actors could be behind the sabotage. In June, research by ZEIT, among others, revealed that the US government had warned the Ukrainian government of an attack on the pipelines months before the attack.

>Ukrainian special forces are said to have planned an attack on another pipeline

>The warning was based on findings by US and Dutch secret services. The CIA had therefore warned against planning the attack, in which six Ukrainian special forces were involved. In addition, according to the new research by Spiegel and ZDF, the USA is said to have warned of a Ukrainian attack on the Turkstream pipeline in the Black Sea, which transports Russian gas to Turkey. The warning went to the Federal Intelligence Service (BND), among others, but they initially classified it as implausible.

> The charter fee had apparently been paid by a Warsaw travel agency called Feeria Lwowa, a company with no website or telephone number... According to the Polish commercial registry, the company is headed by a 54-year-old woman named Nataliia A., who lives in Kyiv  

Good job Spiegel. But oh no! Here comes [RTL](https://www.n-tv.de/politik/Nord-Stream-Sprengung-Die-Spur-fuehrt-nach-Moskau-article24250566.html) who looked a little deeper and found the 95% shareholder of Feeria Lwowa, a ""Diana B"" who apparently had a Ukrainian passport. Except she also has a Russian passport, and is resident of occupied Crimea, and has links to the occupation authorities. Last seen in Russia, moving about freely. Kinda strange for a Ukrainian saboteur.

Comment,"Only one pipe is damaged if there was really political will, the pipeline could be patched. 

Long before the war Germany had already pubished its plan to phase out Russian gas for good. It was only because this plan was already in motion that Russian gas could be substituted so quickly. 

Destroying the pipeline was strategically useless. The only bad repercussion would be on Ukraine's side if it really turns out they were involved. After all they have Nato and EU ambitions. 

I am still hoping it was Russia, they blew their pope to Georgia too during the Russia- Georgia war in 2008. 

Btw, lots of countries in Europe are still importing Russian gas at this very moment. And not only gas, coal as well and uranium. Russian gas transit to Europe through Ukraine continues to this day at a rate of 35–40 million cubic meters per day.",2023-11-11T17:36:57,berlinwombat,3,Comment,https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/11/11/nordstream-bombing-ukraine-chervinsky/?utm_campaign=wp_main&utm_medium=social&utm_source=reddit.com

Furthermore certain articles are saying Hamas has fired close to 10000 rockets since October 7th but thankfully Israel invested in the iron dome. The damage could easily be much higher if not for the Iron Dome as Hamas can’t target as precisely as Israel do

It’s quite alarming how you paint Israel as the enemy here. Hamas neglects, steals from, terrorizes and kills Gaza’s civilians for 15+ years and you don’t give a shit. But when Israel tells those same civilians they need to flee because they can’t guarantee their safety while they deal with an active terrorist threat (Hamas), suddenly you have an issue.

So you don’t actually care about innocent civilians on either side, you only care that Israel is defending itself. Got it. Kind of upsetting there are so many of you Hamas’ apologists that sit there and spout their lies and propaganda as truth.",2023-11-11T14:12:23,SeveranceZero,3,Comment,https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-must-protect-palestinians-west-bank-un-rights-chief-2023-11-10/

Not the best example given 6M Jews died in a genocide, whereas the Israelis left Gaza so the Palestinians could control land that was occupied.

""Have you watched literally nothing about the conditions in Gaza? How is any society supposed to create a ""state"" with no resources""

Don't they get millions, if not billions in donations? How does Hamas have $100M for rockets, or the PA $300M for the Pay to slay program?

There's money there but it would take leaders who give a fuck about the Palestinians. 

""Surveilled by the IDF 24/7/365 (except on 10/7).""

Turns out there's a terror organization leading Gaza. Might have something to do with the surveillance. 

 ""Peppered with US bombs ""because Hamas"", sniped at from the edges of the walls enclosing them. What kind of fucking state is this?""

And, you know, also because terrorists fire rockets into Israel daily, and Hamas slaughtered 1200+ civilians and said they wouldn't stop until Israel is destroyed.

 ""State of slow death is what it is. They're going to die slowly, or go out swinging.""

So now you're justifying terrorist violence. That explains a lot.

Weird how peace never came into your argument. Not surprised, but worth pointing out yet again.

Yeah, let’s just keep repeating that. I’m sure it won’t lead to another massacre of Israelis like Hamas has promised to do. Even though 60% of Palestinians polled say that even if they get a state it should be used to continue attacking the rest of Israel.

First, most of the parties accept to participate in the march. There are only two parties (aside from the micro-parties which are irrelevant) that refuse to participate. One is the communist party, that said they didn't want to march with the RN because of its history of antisemitism, but it's very hypocritical of them because the communists collaborated with the Nazis from 1939 to 1941. The other is France Insoumise, Mélenchon's party, who refuse to participate in the march because Mélenchon qualifies it of a ""reunion of the people supporting massacres in Gaza"", which clearly shows what he believes of Jews. Mélenchon has also been accused of antisemitism over the years, and especially since the 7/10 as he refused to said it was a terrorist attack and to qualify the Hamas of a terrorist organization.

But we're supposed to be okay when the main left party openly supports the Hamas, refuse to call the 7 October attacks terrorism and doesn't want to go to the march, on top of wanting to do it's own Pro-Palestine march.
Or already did march with people that are openly antisemitists.

> It was on our orders that François Mitterrand remained in the Vichy prison service. When he was nominated for the francisque, we were kept fully informed; we advised him to accept this 'distinction' so as not to reveal himself.

This is going to affect all shipping lines that are contracted to use DP World, all wharves with containers under DP World control gumming up the works and not getting out of the way as they would under normal conditions, all other wharf terminal operators absolutely scrambling 25/8 (not enough hours in the day nor days in the week, sorry) in an attempt to do their best to keep things moving, export freight being unable to move through trucking company yards (they often run their own container yards to temporarily hold containers while waiting for the wharves to open for accepting freight) and thus also blocking their ability in general to handle containers in a timely manner, export companies unable to pack freight because they've run out of yard space for containers, and thus export companies having to suspend manufacturing/packing.

Plus more, e.g. the freight forwarding companies who normally do all the co-ordination between shipping line/wharf, trucking companies, other involved companies as required, and the importer/exporter.

Poland is, or, maybe and hopefully **WAS** (it seems as if the liberal/pro EU parties manage to form a coalition, despite PISs getting most votes again) run by the equivalent of the ""Freedom caucus"". That isnt even an exaggeration. Down to the love of conspiracy theories. They even got their own ""jet fuel cant melt steal beams"", the Smolensk air desaster. Why they would ""aid"" russia? Because they fucking hate Liberal ""Eurogays"" a tiny, tiny bit less than they hate russia. And they are *great* admirers of authoritarians and their laws as well as their interpretation of human rights, and in particular of Orbans handling of the hungarian press and politics (hatred for LGBTQ+, refugees/migrants, womens and minority rights, liberal policies) in general. So much that they try to copy them. Even against EU laws. Do you start to understand where this is going?

The EU wants to nail their ass to the wall for their bullshit and constant violations of EU laws and principles for as long as they want to bring the hammer down on Hungary. So Poland gives Hungary a nice rimjob and vetos any attempt by the EU to sanction them, and in return they get a reach around from Hungary every time the EU tries to go for Poland.

2. False. Austria can't legally sent military aid and the same is true for Ireland and Malta. Then there's Iceland who doesn't even have an army. All of these countries have sent non-lethal aid to Ukraine. 
3. Austria vetoed the Shengen enlargement because atm it's against Austria's interest. The only thing the migration crisis has to do with Russia is that Russia is using migration as weapon against Europe and the EU has been doing shit about it.

Comment,">An Israel Defence Forces (IDF) spokesperson said: “Earlier today, the IDF received reports of a hit on the Shifa hospital in Gaza City. The Hamas-run media office in the Gaza Strip immediately claimed that this was a strike carried out by the IDF. An examination of IDF operational systems indicates that a misfired projectile launched by terrorist organisations inside the Gaza Strip hit the Shifa hospital. The misfired projectile was aimed at IDF troops operating in the vicinity.”

Comment,"I too have found them to be kind of unbiased. There is some... Flavor, for lack of a better word, in some of their articles that shows some bias. Like when referencing certain territories or parties, they will avoid crossing the line of what is considered the official stance of Israel relating to those territories and parties. Nothing too major. And I wasn't exactly expecting them to recognise the State of Palestine or anything.

Comment,"Did I say I am “good with it”? No. I did not say that. Why do you misrepresent what it is I have said? 

Hamas would be justified in striking Israeli military targets, if those targets are colocated with the prisoners Israel has taken them their deaths would be collateral damage resulting from striking a legitimate target. That is not what Hamas does and Israel does not colocated their military with civilians.

Hamas does intentionally place their military assets and operates from civilian buildings and among civilian populations. It is the intent of Hamas to make sure civilians die if they are attacked. Those deaths that result from IDF striking legitimate targets is entirely the responsibility of Hamas. Same goes for the hostages that Hamas has taken, it is their responsibility to keep them safe and keeping them around active military positions is on Hamas. 

Nothing in that says I am “good with it” it is simply how the laws of war work and how reality works. Your emotional response doesn’t change reality.",2023-11-11T13:06:44,codan84,9,Comment,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/10/netanyahu-says-israel-is-not-seeking-to-occupy-gaza
Comment,"As long as you are consistent with who and what applies as a military target I’m willing to acknowledge the soundness of your argument, but my point was that that isn’t the general response on Reddit. Most people are calling for the deaths of children as if they decided to be there. That’s what I’m taking issue with, the idea that these children are responsible for their deaths as if they chose to be shields for Hamas.

Edit: also, proportionality must still be considered when attacking legitimate targets with civilians present. One Hamas member does not constitute a legitimate target. Not that I’m saying that is what you are claiming",2023-11-11T13:26:59,CowsgoMo0,1,Comment,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/10/netanyahu-says-israel-is-not-seeking-to-occupy-gaza
Comment,"I have seen no one calling for the deaths of children, other than Hamas and their supporters. 

There is a problem that people like yourself equate the attacks on actual military targets that result in the deaths of civilians as being attacks on children. It is hyperbolic emotional manipulation and not at all a rational view of what is going on. That and taking the casualty numbers from Hamas as gospel and assuming they were all innocent civilians. 

The civilians are not responsible, Hamas and their Islamist buddies are responsible. They intend for civilians to die so as to gain support from naive and overly emotional westerner that lose all rational thought when “think of the children” is cried. 

If you want fewer civilians killed you should support IDF and hope they can destroy Hamas’s capability to wage war as quickly as possible. That is how the most civilians can be spared, both now and in the future. Ceasefires, pauses, trying to tie the hands of the IDF all support Hamas and will drag the conflict out further allowing Hamas to follow through with what they themselves say they want. They want endless war and have stated plainly that they intend to repeat the attacks on the 7th again and again until Israel is destroyed.",2023-11-11T13:34:29,codan84,4,Comment,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/10/netanyahu-says-israel-is-not-seeking-to-occupy-gaza

Comment,"Again you misrepresent what I say. Are you doing that intentionally? 

If Hamas places a rocket launcher in a school, that school under the laws of war is no longer a protected site. The cause of it losing its protected status is Hamas using it for military purposes. A belligerent in a conflict is not protected by using civilians to shield their military, they have a duty to take actions to prevent civilians from being killed. Hamas is not doing their duty and is in fact taking actions to ensure more civilians die. You don’t seem to care at all about that. You don’t really care about the civilians in Gaza, you only point at Israel. You blame Israel for crimes that Hamas are culpable. 

You don’t have to agree, but that is how the laws of war work. That is the reality of the situation. You not liking it doesn’t change anything and you substituting your wants for reality is not reasonable.

Comment,"Here’s how I see your argument, I’ll use two premises and a conclusion please tell me if I’m wrong. 

1. Hamas illegally uses innocent civilians as humans shields in order to dissuade Israel from using otherwise justified force
2. The bombing is justified (and also legal) because they are specifically targeting Hamas
3. The deaths of the innocent civilians used as shields by Hamas is justified, but the fault lies with Hamas for using human shields in war. 

I’m not saying that you want these civilians dead, and I understand how the one responsible for the hostages being there in the first place is Hamas.

Did I get your argument correctly? Because if I did, I still have issue with premise 2. I don’t believe the targeting of Hamas is justified depending on the number of civilians likely to become casualties. I’m also not calling for a complete ceasefire, but rather I’m trying to argue that the IDF should be encouraged to show restraint in the face of mass civilian casualties.",2023-11-11T17:00:03,CowsgoMo0,2,Comment,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/10/netanyahu-says-israel-is-not-seeking-to-occupy-gaza

You can't bomb a target unless you can prove *that target* is a military facility.
Just like a cop can't search you trunk for drugs without a warrant without evidence of drugs on that trunk.

Comment,">Who gets the benefit of the doubt here

As I have posted many times , benefit of the doubt is explicitly granted to protected areas .

“in case of doubt whether an object which is normally dedicated to civilian purposes, such as a place of worship, a house or other dwelling or a school, is being used to make an effective contribution to military action, it shall be presumed not to be so used”

Comment,"You linked the IDF claiming Hamas operates out of Al-Shifa, you haven't posted proof of Hamas operating out of Al-Shifa  (and if they did, that would justify attacking*Al-Shifa*)

The only evidence that page has is for Al-Wafa hospital being militarized, but Al-Wafa isn't one of the hospitals the OP talked about being attacked.

Hamas being known to operate in hospitals doesn't make every hospital a military target anymore than drug traffickers using cars means a cop has probable cause to search any car trunk.

The article you linked actually explained it well:
 ""Footage from the 2014 Gaza war shows Hamas launching rockets from the premises of al-Wafa Hospital in Gaza City, rendering the facility a military target. ""

Something similar needs to happen every time a protected area is targeted. They are all illegal to strike by default, until a specific incident or observation about *that target* renders *that target* militarized.

If it worked the way you are talking, every hospital, mosque, apartment and ambulance in Gaza would be a valid military target by default.

It is very similar to felony murder laws in the US. When one commits a felony and another dies as a result of that crime is their responsibility, even if they did not personally kill anyone. 

Hamas intentionally created the circumstances that place the civilians in harms way. Hamas has prevented civilians from leaving.

Comment,"They have been doing both. The classic chain is

It was a Hamas misfire, if it wasn't a Hamas misfire it was us but we weren't aiming at the hospital, if we were aiming at the hospital it's because there were fighters shooting at us from it, it there weren't fighters shooting from it there was a Hamas office in it, if there wasn't a Hamas office in it, there was a Hamas base under it.

For example after bombing Al Sheikh hospital the IDF posted a video claiming that a hole in the rubble was a Hamas tunnel, but footage existed for years of it being constructed as a closed off water reservoir and one of the buildings engineers confirmed it.

In a better world Israel (and any other military) would be mandated to keep records of all verifications of a target being militarized and have to supply them for verification to an independent checker upon request.

They have others in tunnels under the streets ready to pop out and kill the police, no matter if they are patrolling the street or in their home asleep.

Comment,"Well, to begin with, most of the farmers in the Amazon area illegally squat over the land hoping that if they ask nicely then the government will let them keep the land now that it has been deforested, but you don't get to be caught commiting a crime and then keep the benefits of it, that would be ridiculous.

Moreover, it's in Brazil's best interest that the Amazon is restored, because it regulates the entire climate of the continent by making it more rainy, so destroying the forest is a literal suicide for a country whose economy relies so heavily on agriculture. Brazil didn't have arid climate in the past, only semi-arid zones in the northeast parts of the country, but thanks to deforestation contributing to reduced rainfail there are now actual deserts forming and if farmers keep having their way the entire northern part of the country will turn into an enourmous desert.

Finally, Brazil is gigantic and there are enough farmland already, but instead of increasing the productivity of the lands they have, many farmers opt to squat over the Amazon where land is basically free and can be effectively used for extensive agriculture that has lower productivity and low added value to it compared to more intensive methods of production.",2023-11-11T19:12:54,Synchrotr0n,2,Comment,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/10/climate/amazon-deforestation-falls-climate-intl/index.html

Comment,"And heres a reminder that the UN Human Rights Council has always had a almost comically obvious bias against Israel:

> As of 2013, the State of Israel had been condemned in 45 resolutions by the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC). Since the UNHRC's creation in 2006, it has resolved almost as many resolutions condemning Israel alone than on issues for the rest of the world combined. The 45 resolutions comprised almost half (45.9%) of all country-specific resolutions passed by the UNHRC, not counting those under Agenda Item 10 (countries requiring technical assistance).

> A number of observers have described this criticism as excessive.

Comment,"I feel like a lot of my fellow progressives are getting hit with this realization like a brick wall, because while well-intended, their positions have come from a place of echo clambering and not education. There's certainly merit to criticizing Isreal and the IDF for their treatment of Palestinians, but I don't think they fully understand what Palestine is or why this issue is complex.


It has become painfully clear that most Americans have no understanding of this scenario, but have doubled down on Palestine or Isreal as a dichotomy for so long that they can't process what's happening. And I think this is just one issue where you have progressives that really thought they were 100% on the right side of history (which I believe we often are), but are beginning to question those beliefs.

I’m in no way condoning what Hamas did but when you have a decades long history of controlling and oppressing people and refusing to allow them sovereignty over territory that you don’t own and illegally occupy, it’s easy to see why some people might get mad and feel the need to fight back.

Comment,"Therein lies a lot of my frustration with many progressive and politically left-wing organizations in the US. Their messaging often ranges from unhelpful to outright counterproductive to their self-stated aims, and while there's some interference from more entrenched political forces, that is not as much of the problem as some progressives would have you believe. How you craft your message is at least as important as what your message actually is, which many American progressives generally seem unwilling or unable to understand. In a democratic society (and, while quite flawed, the US is still a democratic society, at least for the time being), being correct or just or ideologically orthodox or whatever accomplishes absolutely nothing if you can't get undecided folks to stand with you when it counts. The GOP, reprehensible though its politics are, understands this principle and uses it to great effect, and the neoliberals, progressives, and others to their left scratch their heads and wonder why there are so many neofascists in positions of power now.

During the events leading up the Holocaust the shah used his position with the Germans as leverage to help many Jews escape Germany by giving them Iranian citizenships. This was because the Germans claimed to be Aryan, meanwhile Iranians are actual Aryans.

Comment,">Wouldn't it be faster and easier to Ethnically cleanse all the Palestinians?

Yes, since there's no such thing as ""Palestinians"" as a distinct people or ethnicity. There's just Arabs living in Palestine, the same way they live in Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, etc. Palestinians are no more an ethnic group than Californians or Texans are. All it would take to ""ethnically cleanse"" them is to recognize that. 

> The Palestinian people do not exist. The creation of a Palestinian state is only a means for continuing our struggle against the state of Israel for our Arab unity. In reality today there is no difference between Jordanians, Palestinians, Syrians and Lebanese. **Only for political and tactical reasons do we speak today about the existence of a Palestinian people, since Arab national interests demand that we posit the existence of a distinct ""Palestinian people"" to oppose Zionism**. Yes, the existence of a separate Palestinian identity exists only for tactical reasons, Jordan, which is a sovereign state with defined borders, cannot raise claims to Haifa and Jaffa, while as a Palestinian, I can undoubtedly demand Haifa, Jaffa, Beer-Sheva and Jerusalem. However, the moment we reclaim our right to all of Palestine, we will not wait even a minute to unite Palestine and Jordan.

Comment,"> And people somehow think they went to war for no reason.

I saw a video yesterday of a super intelligent young woman who was protesting against ""the Jews"" who outright stated that no such thing ever happened. Some may genuinely be ignorant enough to actually believe that, but a lot are just lying to justify their bigotry too.

Comment,"> but for some “unknown” reason they don’t get nearly as much coverage or hate

It's actually pretty simple, but the folks who peddle this line really don't like to hear the answer because it doesn't conform to their expectation of everyone else as some antisemitic nutjob.

Other crises, ethnic cleansings, etc., are also tragic (and often much fuss is made about them, just not in channels that *you* pay attention to or are *brought* to your attention by news outlets who find it useful to do so) but **they are not given the same tacit or explicit support** of the governments of those protesters.

When we talk about the genocide in Darfur, **America has not been dumping tens of millions of dollars worth of weapons and military support into the hands of the belligerants for years upon years**. It turns out to be very easy for the American government to look at that situation and say, ""Woah, woah, this is all kinds of fucked up, stop the killing, ceasefire now."" And on the general public's side, you may see calls for America to involve itself in *helping stop that violence* through political pressure or other means. 

Compare that to the Israel-Palestine situation where the American government **very much does help arm and money the Israeli forces**. My tax dollars ain't going to homemade rockets for Hamas, and while aid money *is* fungible, we can say the same for Iron Dome cash turning into Israeli bomb cash--and in way bigger amounts. And it's not so easy, evidently, for America to say ""Woah, woah, this is all kinds of fucked, stop the killing, ceasefire now,"" in this case, because apparently every few years we've got to ""let"" Israel get a few licks in on hundreds or thousands of *FUCKING CHILDREN* or they'll get cranky. There's never any problem condemning Hamas, to be sure, but we try very hard to avoid ever suggesting Israel might be going too far or that it isn't their *RIGHT* to go there because, gosh darnit, they're mad and someone poked them first (when we restrict our view to a very specific timeframe). And again, the public pressure is on asking America (or whatever other national government) to lean on Israel to knock it off **or at least stop giving them the money they use to do this shit**, because that's actually the faction these governments have influence with. 

Like, no one feels a *need* to ask the American government to tell Hamas to stop killing people because **that's a given**. It's already the stated policy of the government. There is no ""actually I disagree with the Biden administration's policy of slaughtering Israeli children, pressure him to ask Hamas to chill instead"" because *that isn't reality*. The closest the US gets to shipping bombs to Hamas is in the form of the ones that *Israel fires at them*. 

Israel are the big boys. They have the power in this situation. They're the ones we have the strongest diplomatic ties with. They're the ones we give the money to. **They're the ones we can actually pressure.** And because we're such good buddies, the US and Israel, or other nations and Israel, it's much more ""on us"" to ask Israel to fucking cool it compared to other fucked up situations where we're not besties with one of the groups involved.

Comment,"The world hasn't cared about tens of thousands of rockets over a period of decades fired at Israel intentionally aimed at civilians either.

Except when Israel fires back. Then headlines around the world proclaim Israel has killed Palestinians, without any mention of the fact that the targets are terrorists.


And when they fire rockets next to a school, and Israel fires back, headlines around the world loudly proclaim, ""Palestinian school damaged by Israeli fire!""


And then people around the world, who already hate Jews because that's the cool thing to do, who only read headlines, have this belief that Israel is just haphazardly firing on Palestinian civilians for no reason. Which is literally the exact opposite of what's happening.


And then people scream apartheid! And they have no idea what apartheid even means, have no idea that Palestinian citizens of Israel have full equal rights, voting rights, that there are Palestinian members of Parliament, Palestinian political parties, judges, including on the Supreme Court, police officers, and in the military, and that Palestinians in Israel have more rights than anywhere in the Arab world, including women's rights, LGBT, better medical care and a better quality of life.


And they have no idea that Israel is a powerhouse of medical and technological research, that many of their medications are developed or produced in Israel, that their cutting-edge medical procedures were developed in Israel, that the Intel chips in their computer use technology developed in Israel, that Windows uses technology developed in Israel, that the software in their Amazon Kindle was developed in Israel, that voicemail and instant messaging were invented in Israel, that Google search, Waze, and Google Maps all use Israeli technology.


Yes, the Google search that everyone uses every day, uses Israeli technology. They have no idea.

And like anyone else it makes me sad that Palestinian citizens are victims in all this just like Israeli citizens were, but you absolutely cannot expect Israel to take that kind of a slaughter sitting down, not can you say they're indiscriminately bombing citizens and not going after Hamas because if they really wanted to blow the shit out of Palestinians, they'd all be gone already.

Comment,"It’s not Israel who decided that only one of the two nations can continue to exist. Israel offered multiple times two state solutions in UN backed treaties. Israel didn’t try to overthrow every potential place of refuge for the Palestinians. Israel didn’t slaughter innocents for the sake of slaughtering them. Israel didn’t insist on Hamas commingling their infrastructure of death with schools, hospitals and every other place treated sacred by the laws of man. 

It’s not that Palestine “should” be destroyed. It’s that they have done everything in their power to ensure that no civilians can survive without death befalling Israel (and anyone else Hamas could possibly manage to kill). So I don’t expect Israel to extend this conflict for millennia more, getting countless of their own killed, to protect the people who spawned this body of death.",2023-11-11T20:43:46,Vexillumscientia,1,Comment,"https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/irans-raisi-the-only-solution-is-a-palestinian-state-from-the-river-to-the-sea/#:~:text=Iranian%20President%20Ibrahim%20Raisi%20tells,%E2%80%9Criver%20to%20the%20sea.%E2%80%9D"

Comment,"It goes back a *long* time. Ben-Gurion coined the phrase ""oom-schmoom"" [back in 1955](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Um-Shmum). ""Oom"" is a transliteration of the Hebrew acronym for UN (UM), and ""schm-"" is a [yiddish prefix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shm-reduplication) that essentially adds a contextual dismissal or mocking tone to any word. It's the root of the common American phrase ""Joe Schmoe"" or the somewhat less common ""schmuck.""

Comment,">At the time of the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, there were approximately 140,000–150,000 Jews living in Iran, the historical center of Persian Jewry.[102]

>Eliz Sanasarian estimates that in 1948–1953, about one-third of Iranian Jews, most of them poor, emigrated to Israel.[72] David Littman puts the total figure of emigrants to Israel in 1948–1978 at 70,000.[80]

>Prior to the Islamic Revolution in 1979, there were 80,000 Jews in Iran, concentrated in Tehran (60,000), Shiraz (8,000), Kermanshah (4,000), Isfahan (3,000). The cities of Khuzistan, as well as Kashan, Tabriz, Hamedan, and Sanandaj had a small Aramaic-speaking Jewish community of about 4,000 people.[103]

>About 95% have since migrated, with the immigration accelerating after the 1979 Islamic Revolution, when the population dropped from around 100,000 to about 40,000.[104]

>In the mid- and late 1980s, it was estimated at 20,000–30,000, rising to around 35,000 in the mid-1990s.[105] According to the Iranian census, the Jewish population of Iran was 8,756 in 2012/2013,[106][107] and 9,826 in 2016.[108]

Can you address this? Please explain how you expect Israel to deal with this problem under the condition of a ceasefire that leaves Hamas in power.

All these people calling for a ceasefire never say what they think Israel should do instead. What should they do? Do you think they should just leave the hostages for dead, leave Hamas in power, and wait for the next terrorist attack? Because **that's what a ceasefire would mean**.

Just come up with a new phase hasn't and doesn't involve or invoke any antisemitism. And before anyone asks or suggests otherwise I don't in any way support or condone Hamas. They are a terrorist organization and do nothing but harm the Palestinian citizens of Gaza. Nor do I in any way with for the destruction of Israel.

Comment,"So their solution of no Hamas is creating more hamas members? What will the civilians whom lost many if not all of their family members become? Isaelo-philes?

Hamas is an idea, just like terrorism btw. How can you fight against an idea? Short of a genocide Hamas, or a group with the ideas of Hamas will survive and will always survive in Gaza because Israel is making sure to replenish their ranks by bombing the sh1t out of them.

Obviously Israel can't exist with Hamas or any terror group next door. This is existential for Israel which is why it is so very baffling that Israel insists in creating more of them.

I parallel this with the war against terrorism. Started in 2001 and it went so very badly that 12 years later we even had as much As a terror state (in Isis) in Iraq. A whole damn terror state.

Fighting terrorism with bombs and killings tends to fuel it. What do you know!

So what Israel should do? I honestly don't know, but the solution can't be creating Hamas members faster than they kill them.

**edit**

And of course such notions are down voted. I think that people revel in the existence of terror groups around Israel. Both sides do. If not you'd see them to be doing what they did to Nazism in Germany. Rebuild their country instead of having punitive measures against them WW1 style (which was actually what gave rise to Nazism in the first place).  But what do I know? All I did was read history.

Comment,"The courageous redditor who replied to this comment blocked me. This is a deliberate tactic to prevent me from replying to them with the information that explains why the information they added is irrelevant.

The US statement that the resolution ""made no mention of Israel's right to defend itself"" is a nonsense deflection, and the entire world knows it. Israel's right to defend itself has never been in question and does not need affirmation in a UNSC resolution. The entire world agrees that Israel has a right to defend itself. Where there is disagreement is whether Israel takes adequate steps to not harm civilians in the process of defending itself (the world is in near unanimous agreement that it doesn't, as represented both by the UNGA resolution and the UNSC resolution which the US unilaterally blocked), and whether or not Israel violates other elements of international law with regards to its occupation of the West Bank and Gaza (again, there is near universal agreement that Israel's settlement building policies in occupied territory, alongside other occupation policies, such as the 18 year blockade on food into Gaza, violate the fourth Geneva convention, and the US stands literally alone in preventing the UNSC from taking action about it, with the UK offering perfunctory abstentions).

So, the statement that ""The resolution made no mention of Israel's right to defend itself"" is a nonsense justification for blocking an enforceable UNSC measure which would require Israel to have a humanitarian ""pause."" This pause something the entire world supports with the exception of the United States and Israel, because the humanitarian situation in Gaza, which Israel placed under a total siege blocking food and water to civilians and allowing Hospitals to run out of supplies, is ABYSMAL.

>Introducing that report, Tarik Alami, Director of the Emerging and Conflict Related Issues Division at the Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA), expressed concerns over Israel’s policies and practices, noting that it has continued consolidating its occupation through measures and policies that are unlawful, discriminatory and appear to constitute collective punishment. “Adherence to international law is an absolute imperative for securing justice and peace for all those living in the region,” he underscored.""

>Speaking before a recorded vote, the observer for the State of Palestine cited Palestinian poet Mahmoud Darwish, stressing:  “We suffer from the incurable malady called hope.”  Spotlighting the draft resolution on the protection of Palestinian women, he stressed that these women “are leaders in our homes, in our streets, in our public and private sphere, in our civil society movement.  They are at the first and last line of defence.”

>The Council then adopted the resolution “Economic and social repercussions of the Israeli occupation on the living conditions of the Palestinian people in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and the Arab population in the occupied Syrian Golan” with a recorded vote of 39 in favour to 4 against (Canada, Israel, Liberia, United States), with 3 abstentions (Côte d'Ivoire, Guatemala, United Kingdom).

Comment,"It's a call for a one-state solution. It always has been and always will be.

The progressive interpretation is that it will be a secular state, with equal rights for all citizens, regardless of ethnicity or religion. Of course, the problem is that even in the hypothetical world where that's even remotely plausible, the assumption that a peaceful, secular democracy will continue to be a peaceful, secular democracy when the citizens of the prospective state have 70 years of hatred and grievances (and that's just the post-WW2 history) separating them is preposterous. It would be like merging Serbia and Albania into one country again. The overwhelming likelihood is a massive pogrom. AND LITERALLY EVERYONE KNOWS THAT.

Anyone who thinks a one-state solution is the answer is either looking forward to the genocide, or needs to be ignored as a dunce.

Comment,"> The Palestinian people do not exist. The creation of a Palestinian state is only a means for continuing our struggle against the state of Israel for our Arab unity. In reality today there is no difference between Jordanians, Palestinians, Syrians and Lebanese. Only for political and tactical reasons do we speak today about the existence of a Palestinian people, since Arab national interests demand that we posit the existence of a distinct ""Palestinian people"" to oppose Zionism. Yes, the existence of a separate Palestinian identity exists only for tactical reasons, Jordan, which is a sovereign state with defined borders, cannot raise claims to Haifa and Jaffa, while as a Palestinian, I can undoubtedly demand Haifa, Jaffa, Beer-Sheva and Jerusalem. However, the moment we reclaim our right to all of Palestine, we will not wait even a minute to unite Palestine and Jordan.

If you want long-term peace, you kill the ideology, either through force (by killing/capturing everyone that believes in said ideology), or through forced re-education.

If you want to minimize deaths, the only path is through forced re-education. Total occupation, segment the region into smaller areas, cut off all communication and inter-mingling between areas. Then re-educate each region, with a total control over any and all education, religious or otherwise. Heavily limited and monitored access to the internet via a China-esque firewall.

Comment,"Mostly correct. A missile is any propelled object (including arrows, javelins, rocks thrown by slings). A rocket is a missile with a motor to propel itself.

A guided missile is a rocket that has some way of being guided to a specific target. It could be something very advanced like GPS guidance, or a system that can autonomously recognize the shape of a tank, or something like the Iron Dome that anticipates the flight path of a rocket. It might be something relatively simple like gyroscopes to prevent random deviation, so it can predictably hit a target the size of a city (eg German V2); a heat sensor that simply turns the missile toward a heat source, without much in the way of anticipating the flight path of that heat source (early air to air missiles); or a long thin wire, connected to a joystick, that allows an operator to manually steer the missile (early anti tank guided missiles).

Since the 50s or 60s, “missile” has been used as shorthand for “guided missile” AKA “guided rocket,” and “rocket” has been used as shorthand for “unguided rocket.” Hence the confusion, where people automatically assume a “missile” is more sophisticated than a “rocket.”

And it can certainly be confusing. Under the old definition of “missile,” all rockets are missiles, but not all missile are rockets. Under the new definition of “missile” (meaning *guided missile*), all missiles are rockets, and not all rockets are missiles. If we combine both definitions, then all missiles are missiles but not all missiles are missiles, LOL. 

I must point out, a rocket is not really “a simple type of missile” under either definition. If we use the old definition of “missile,” the simplest rocket is more advanced than all missiles that existed before gunpowder. Missiles range in complexity from a javelin thrown by a hunter gatherer, to a US-made Javelin antitank missile currently being used in Ukraine. The rockets launched by Hamas sit *roughly in the middle* of that very wide spectrum. If we use the new definition of “missile” (guided missile) then most rockets used by Hamas are not missiles at all.",2023-11-11T12:56:18,Sax45,20,Comment,"https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/irans-raisi-the-only-solution-is-a-palestinian-state-from-the-river-to-the-sea/#:~:text=Iranian%20President%20Ibrahim%20Raisi%20tells,%E2%80%9Criver%20to%20the%20sea.%E2%80%9D"

Comment,"There's a difference between ""chairing a poorly attended two-day social forum of the Human Rights Council"" and ""being the [president of the Human Rights Council](https://www.ohchr.org/en/hr-bodies/hrc/presidency),"" who is indeed some Czech guy. Like, did you even read the article you're sharing? It's impossible to tell if you're disingenuous or media illiterate, but it's one or the other (or both).

The HRC is also [different from the OHCHR](https://www2.ohchr.org/english/press/hrc/kit/hrcs_fs2.pdf) (Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights). Basically, the OHCHR does objective fact-finding and Human Rights promoting, and is not beholden to member states, but holds positions by appointment from the Secretary General and has an independent mandate to investigate Human Rights abuses. Most UN reports you read are from them. (By the way, the High Comissioner of the OHCHR is also not Iranian, but is [some Austrian guy](https://www.ohchr.org/en/about-us/high-commissioner)). The UNHRC, on the other hand, is an intergovernmental body that holds meetings to discuss Human Rights and respond to international Human Rights crises, and passes resolutions representing the opinion of the International Community regarding Human Rights abuses (including [in Iran](https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G22/602/10/PDF/G2260210.pdf?OpenElement)).

So, how did we get from ""Iran is chairing a sparsely attended meeting for an already frequently criticized intergovernmental body?"" to ""Iran is in charge of Human Rights at the UN""? How this works every time: Israeli government puts out a standard statement condemning something they don't like from the UN (for example, that a [resolution calling for a Gaza ceasefire didn't include a statement condemning Hamas](https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-un-resolutions-russia-brazil-c601d6aefe9d853428a485c9b6011830)). These Israeli statements leave out basic details, like the fact that the [UN immediately condemned Hamas](https://press.un.org/en/2023/sgsm21981.doc.htm) on 7/10, and that including a condemnation of Hamas to the resolution would have no impact on SC implementation of the policy. Propaganda outlets then amplify this diplomatic non-event by applying outlandish framing that the Israeli government could never get away with in official diplomatic statements, such as ""[UN REFUSES TO CONDEMN HAMAS](https://www.foxnews.com/world/after-failing-to-condemn-hamas-terror-group-un-adopts-8-resolutions-condemning-jewish-state)."" This becomes the talking point among illiterates who don't know how to use google and love guzzling propaganda. Pertinent facts, like the fact that the [US unilaterally blocked a resolution condemning Hamas](https://apnews.com/article/un-security-council-resolution-gaza-hamas-1c23913f8552f5379b2c158a83493835), are conveniently left out of this entire news cycle.",2023-11-11T12:59:38,ForkShoeSpoon,6,Comment,"https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/irans-raisi-the-only-solution-is-a-palestinian-state-from-the-river-to-the-sea/#:~:text=Iranian%20President%20Ibrahim%20Raisi%20tells,%E2%80%9Criver%20to%20the%20sea.%E2%80%9D"

Comment,"Yeah that’s true. If rocket-like object is powered by something other than a rocket motor, is it a rocket?
Making this even more confusing, we should point out a rocket motor is a type of jet engine (it propels using a jet of gas), but when we say “jet engine” we usually mean something that is air-breathing (turbojet, ramjet, pulse jet).

There is also some ambiguity with loitering munitions (AKA kamikaze drones). Is a loitering munition a remotely operated aircraft with a built-in suicide capability, or is it a cruise missile with extra ability to hang around for a while waiting for the right moment/target? Or both? If a loitering munition is a type of missile, then we can definitely say that “not all missiles are rockets.” Most loitering munitions share almost nothing in common with most rockets, other than the fact that most have an explosive warhead.",2023-11-11T15:39:03,Sax45,1,Comment,"https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/irans-raisi-the-only-solution-is-a-palestinian-state-from-the-river-to-the-sea/#:~:text=Iranian%20President%20Ibrahim%20Raisi%20tells,%E2%80%9Criver%20to%20the%20sea.%E2%80%9D"

Comment,"Oh, you're completely lost to Hamas propaganda & clearly nothing will change that, but here goes. 

If Israel didn't care about preserving human life, they would have never attempted multiple peace deals via a two state solution, would use the nukes they have access to, would never give evacuation orders & would never risk their own soldier's lives to maximize precision. These are obvious facts.

Look, I don't agree with everything the Israeli government has done, but if you believe Israel is committing ""constant transgressions"", you clearly have absolutely zero knowledge of the complex context in which such ""transgressions"" occur. Israel has repeatedly offered to cede land previously occupied out of necessity (to prevent what happened on Oct 7th) to, again, attempt to make peace. Israel isn't the big bad evil you think it is & it's been under constant attack from countries who fundamentally despise Jews since its inception.

Comment,"That's an ... interesting view of history. Contentious though. By many modern historians the firebombing of Tokyo and Dresden (or similar) respectively was not necessary. Merely an act of revenge for everything those two nations did for 10 years + (in the case of Japan particularly). 

Scorched earth tactics and a bad peace also brought the degeneracy of the Weimar Republic which gave rise to an even worse evil than WW 1.

Things in Middle East doesn't have to have hit rock bottom, it's possible that things can get way worse if they raze the Gaza strip and then end on a bad peace.

We *almost* had this at the end of WW2 (a bad peace) but fortunately cold war dynamics forced nation building and we were saved by the bell.

I don't know (or think) that Israelis care to give an inch to Palestinians. I think they will go with the bad peace angle they went every time they defeated them. And every bad peace would give rise to an even worse monster than before. That's why it is circa 2023 that you had the worst attacks, even worse than a second Intifada. Violence breeds violence and unless something *drastic* ends up happening, you re looking for the nth bad peace in a row (in the region) which will end up giving rise to the next monster which I fear will be worse than current Hamas. Things only ever escalate over there... unless a lid is put, Things go more and more towards total chaos.

And yes, razing cities is one of the agents of chaos, as they were even in the case of WW 2. What happened after saved them (and the world), but I have no confidence that's that what we'll see here.

Israel seems to see themselves as arbirters of their nation's defense alone. But on fact being the strongest military in the area they are also arbirters of peace, and they have to start taking leading role in that *once* they manage to vanquish their enemy again.

The more they see defense as merely vanquishing their attacker, the more their attacker will return. They have to start intervening, often in positive ways, in neighboring nations. The Abraham Accords was a good start (as far as positive interventions go), sadly underwater now.

Where did I say anything about you caring about war crimes? I asked you what you think the number of dead would be.

Every single rocket Hamas launches is a war crime, every single hostage they took is a war crime, every child they slaughtered by hand is a war crime, the hundreds of suicide bomber attacks they’ve conducted over the past 75 years have all been war crimes.

Comment,"Hamas has killed 1400, in 12 hours, not even a single day. At this low end of 1400 people per day, they'd reach 43400 people in a month, and obviously if they were given 24 hours/day, they'd kill much more than 1400 people per day.

If Israel did not care about civilians, much more would have died in a month, and had Hamas had the same military power as Israel they'd probably kill millions in a month.

So many other armies over the past decade alone have slaughtered hundreds of thousands of fully innocent civilians and you clowns don’t give a shit. Never seen you protesting on the streets for any of them.

Hamas openly states they purposely launch from civilian areas to force the IDF to strike a civilian area or not respond at all. 

Do you also harbor hate for the British because they bombed German civilians back in WW2? Was Britian not just in defending itself from Germany?

Hmmmmmm.... Something to think about. If China cannot get enough oil, would they be able to ramp up coal mining to cover the loss? I heard lots of complaints last year from Chinese citizens last year that there was not enough coal to go around. 

Plus - coal burning adds to the already burdened atmosphere,  contributing significantly to global warming.

If the fuel is supposedly (easily retconned) heading to a very cold region of Russia, they get to cry-bully that their civilians are freezing to death. 

The truth is that they’re probably trying to export as much fossil fuel as possible in exchange for munitions, weapons, diplomatic favors, etc. Those folks are going to freeze, regardless. It’s just like when the Soviet Union exported grain for machinery / goods while Ukrainians starved during the famines.

Worse yet, they’ll probably just spend that time yeeting cruise missiles into Ukraine and waiting until Ukraine actually launches attacks on Russia and then plays victim.

The way I see it, Ukraine needs to completely and decisively defeat the Russian military. Totally break it into pieces. Grind the Russia economy into nothingness so it can never afford to do this again. Gain immediate entry into NATO. NATO forces deployed into Ukraine. Employ the fuck around and find out doctrine.

For me, NATO should deploy small amounts of forces in western and central Ukraine - enough away from the front, yet still a subtle reminder to Russia that that is the line.

When oil factory at some village will be destroyed, russian propaganda will yell because Ukrainians are nazi and it will work for some, but for others there would be option of doubt, because Ukraine said before they will target refinery as response for targeting electricity sector in Ukraine. This will not solve anything, but it always nice to have civilians who doubt their own government.",2023-11-11T13:28:46,shustrik_n,3,Comment,https://www.yahoo.com/news/ukraine-energy-minister-floats-potential-184211634.html

Comment,"> Why would you supply Ukraine with power if you’re Russia?

Because it's a power *grid*. Power grids often function as a complete system, where it's difficult to disconnect one part of the grid from another.

Remember that Russia and Ukraine have a long history of being allies before this shit started up a decade ago. They shared energy infrastructure through and through. It's kind of like the US and Canada, the power grid is heavily interconnected and it would be a huge hassle for Canada and the US to ""unplug"" from each other.

Ukraine/Russia war is sort of equivlaent to the US and Canada going to war. That's one of the reasons it's such a stupid, tragic and pointless war. Both nations would have been far stronger as allies (though Ukraine is showing they can be strong regardless, which is pretty awesome.)",2023-11-11T14:08:19,zorinlynx,0,Comment,https://www.yahoo.com/news/ukraine-energy-minister-floats-potential-184211634.html
Comment,"> Why would you not take all available steps to hurt your invading enemy if you are Ukraine?

Because after a certain level the response is your cities get nuked and you pray the west hits them back on your behalf.

I know that we joke about Russia's nuclear threats but they would do it after some level of escalation, and completely crippling their economy might be one actual red line",2023-11-11T14:20:10,Rinzack,0,Comment,https://www.yahoo.com/news/ukraine-energy-minister-floats-potential-184211634.html

It's agonizing to watch Ukraine fight this war with one hand behind their back because Western leaders rightly or wrongly are concerned more about their own GDP and 'escalation' than the survival of Ukraine or the end of Putinist aggression.",2023-11-11T19:14:11,DavidlikesPeace,1,Comment,https://www.yahoo.com/news/ukraine-energy-minister-floats-potential-184211634.html

Comment,"Yet the fallout is Africa and grain exportation because that’s what Putin will attack next. The situation in Darfur and the Sudan will be worsened drastically; along with other African countries and the Ukrainian economy. 

“As of July 2023, the programme had bought 80% of its grain stock from Ukraine, up from 50% before the war. Over 725 000 tonnes of wheat left Ukrainian ports to Ethiopia, Yemen, Afghanistan, Sudan, Somalia, Kenya and Djibouti during the implementation of the initiative.”
-consilium.europa.eu. 

There is a rather large and unpleasant deficiency in reporting on how bad the situation in Sudan is. Putin and friends will attempt to cripple African nations when they need the grain and supplies most. The new grain corridor needs to be incredibly well protected, African reception of these products (food), should be protected by the UN and possibly NATO.

That goes away if Russia starts broadly attacking Ukraine's energy infrastructure though.  It also removes Russia's justification for using nuclear arms as response to Ukraine destroying their infrastructure.

Comment,"Millenium is a stretch, but Ukrainian troops burned down a chunk of Moscow in the early 17th century, as part of the Polish expeditionary force to support a Polish prince's claim to the Muscovy throne. Note - ""Russia"" became a thing with Peter I in the early 18th c.

Then 30-ish years later the Zaporozhian Host rebelled against Polish mistreatment of Orthodox and entered what they thought was a military alliance with the Moscow tzar in 1654. Tzar viewed it differently, and it was all downhill from there for Central/Eastern Ukraine. The split also weakened Poland enough to trigger the Deluge and subsequent partitions.

So yeah, this war was ~4 centuries in the making, with unsuccessful attempts in 1917-1921 and (controversially) 1940-1953.

Comment,"That’s a bit of a stretch. 

Ancient historical claims based on some version of ethnic identity, make good talking points in debates, but they don’t drive real world politics. Look at the modern state of Israel for a great example there.

The conflict is 100% economics, but like all modern conflicts the excuse, for it is rooted in nationalism, which is a very new concept. General consensus among historians is that the way we define ourselves as nations with discrete lines on a map, did not truly exist until after World War I. And when you draw lines on a map, inevitably you put somebody on the wrong side of the line because human society is a continuum without clear dividing lines. It’s undeniable that there were ethnic Russians in the disputed regions of eastern Ukraine, and they felt they have been put on the wrong side of the line, which doesn’t really matter, except that it was the verbal excuse for the war instead of admitting economic motivations. This is sort of like how Hitler used the presence of ethnic Germans in the Sudetenland, in western Poland and in France as an excuse for invasion - during that short time when diplomacy was still on the table.

Of course in this case, it’s horribly complicated by the forced repatriation and Russification about lying territories under the Soviet era. If we actually go back hundreds or thousands of years to try to answer the question of what exactly is a Russian or Ukrainian anyway, eventually becomes a completely arbitrary ethnolinguistic dividing line (which can be a said of any ethnic identity). My first linguistics professor said it best: the only difference between languages and dialects is politics.

Comment,"> They mostly aim to hurt civilians infrastructure, but you must only target military targets!

You do know that it has been shown in every conflict since WW2 that attacking civilian infrastructure always strengthens the morale of said civilians, right? Hitler lost his conflict with the UK (when it was basically ONLY the UK vs the Axis) because he stopped targeting military and industrial assets with bombing runs and started bombing London. Or you can look at the USA with Vietnam. Or any other example where one side targeted civilians; there are plenty. I think the only one where that might not be the case was Russia and Chechnya. Part of that is my own ignorance on the conflict, and the other part is that Russia just completely levelled at least one entire city via artillery.

I agree that it's a little silly that Ukraine isn't allowed to use weapons on targets inside of the Russian border, but not attacking civilian targets is by far one of the best military doctrines available in the 21st century.",2023-11-11T13:20:56,TSED,8,Comment,https://www.yahoo.com/news/ukraine-energy-minister-floats-potential-184211634.html

The only extra escalation is the one in reference here and Russia knows it. It's a lose-lose.

In regards to the idea that Russia has any actual ready reserves; that idea was auto-debunked when Prigozhin marched to Moscow and there was nobody available to stop him except a couple of attack helicopters.

Comment,"After WWII Germany was divided between allies and had foreign military bases in it. That didn't let nationalist revisionist resentment get into the public, gain traction and start everything over again. We don't know how it would go had Germany not been occupied / tightly controlled by the allies. 

I've read articles on Germans' attitude to the Nazi post WWII and the polls listed there showed the sympathy to the Nazi was declining gradually over decades. Not an immediate leap to total condemnation as it might seem today. Occupation didn't let the sympathy materialize in political movements, that's why it stopped. 

The investments helped rebuild the country, yes, but weren't the defining factor.

Regarding Russia, after the collapse of the USSR it had all the opportunities to build a decent country. Warm relationship with the West, Western investments in hundreds of billions dollars, trillions from oil and gas over the time. What did they do with it all?

Comment,"Meh. Versailles was not uniquely harsh. It failed because it was barely enforced or enforceable, thanks to America's desire to immediately leave Europe after WWI + Weimar was born rotten, most of its soldiers already anti-communist (and anti-democratic) monarchists and pseudo-fascists. 

The Allies were far harsher towards Germany after WW2 than they ever were after Versailles, yet soft fascist propaganda about the unfairness of it all keeps getting free airtime and probably always will. But far more thoroughly than in 1918, Germany was demilitarized, occupied, reshaped, and stripped of its war industries after 1945. An entire province, militaristic Prussia, was erased. 

All the things Hitler accused the allies of in 1918 happened quite literally in 1945. And it worked. What worked in nation-building was an effective military occupation + formal reeducation of an entire nation + Marshal Plan investment. It all took decades and it required the outlawing of fascist propaganda.

Comment,"If Ukraine loses and you think that “nothing happens” it’s very self-soothing stance. Not only world will become much much more unstable and dangerous place but RU will come out of this having really big army with REAL war experience opposite to any NATO country that only practiced their mostly outdated doctrines and theories or fought vs mojaheds and much weaker armies. Russia also will use captured lands as source of new recruits and can quickly indoctrinate all who’s left with their propaganda that is really powerful weapon of RU. The power that Tucker Carlson can only dream of, combined with widespread spy network and bribing everyone with infinite petrodollars. Also, you think that article 5 is kinda automatic. It’s not. And then we quickly end up in situation “Do we end world for these Baltic countries, I don’t even know where they are?” and “Do we start annihilation because of Poland? Let’s start negotiations for cease fire”. Russians realized that ad nuclear power you can play daring game and they are willing to dare West a lot. No Western democracy is ready to deal with suicidal armies of autocracies where state is much much over any individual. In WW2 only by hands of Soviet autocracy and its insane human lives cost it was possible to defeat fascist Germany. Democracies are very bad at wars, let’s be brutally honest. Only chance is to secure very big technological dominance but this is not the case yet tho US really accelerated but need minimum 10 years.

Despite this the US has prohibited strikes inside russia with their weapons. It's about escalation. By slowly escalating we entrapped Russia. If we do more Russia goes belly up and it's a fucking mess like the 90's all over again. If the boat sinks slowly however the passengers and crew will jump ship as the water laps their ankles, and eventually the captain will go down alone.

This would be a compelling replacement for TOW on humvees, since you don't have to stick half your ass out of the armor to aim and fire the missile.  

In addition, as part of a static defense, they can be operated from nearby bunkers, which is a boon to both survivability and stealth -- the gunner's body temperature can be seen easily by modern IR optics.

That's the theory at least, but at every step of the way so far Russia has reacted, sometimes well and sometimes less so, and people have stopped leaving the sinking ship as those with the resources to do so largely already have done, and each escalatory step has been followed by Russia saying 'welp, the new aid is no better than what we were already fighting against' without any significant response.

Each failure to escalate significantly will extend this war and cost more Ukrainian lives - Putin sees the 'west's' inability to seriously escalate over the last ~18 months as a major sign of weakness and that if he *just hangs in there* then eventually NATO and the EU will give up and just sorta let him win.",2023-11-11T12:23:59,DonniesAdvocate,18,Comment,https://www.yahoo.com/news/ukraine-energy-minister-floats-potential-184211634.html

Nukes would only enter the equation if either the life of Putin and his inner circle was in direct danger or possibly if somehow Russia was going to lose control over Crimea.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hrim-2

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilkha

> The Vilkha has been seen in use with the Ukrainian Ground Forces during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. Ivan Vinnyk, first deputy head of the National Association of Ukrainian Defense Industries has confirmed on 1 March 2023 that “Yes, the Vilkha has been used in combat,” first used in May 2022. Vilkha-M rockets have a greater range and heavier payload compared to GMLRS rockets fired by U.S.-supplied M142 HIMARS.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-360_Neptune

> A land attack variant was being designed and, as of April 2023, was close to completion. The Neptune missile was initially designed to hit ships at sea. According to a Ukrainian official: ""Ukraine is working to modify Neptune missile to strike land targets ... A new guiding/homing system is required, but Ukrainians are working on that ... Once we get that, the Neptunes can hit targets 360 km (about 225 miles) away. We are pretty close.""

> On 23 August 2023, according to Ukrainian media reports, a modified R-360 missile was used to help destroy a S-400 missile system radar, deployed on Cape Tarkhankut in Crimea since 2016. On 14 September, Ukrainian forces subsequently claimed to have destroyed S-400 missile systems near Yevpatoriya using drones and Neptune missiles.[",2023-11-11T13:59:10,Sensitive_Yellow_121,13,Comment,https://www.yahoo.com/news/ukraine-energy-minister-floats-potential-184211634.html

Also why US doesn't want Russia destroyed, we have a lot to rebuild in ukraine, but russia will not be able to afford rebuilding and aid will be nonexistent.Their industrial and mineral base will be what keeps them going through the fall, keep the people employed, and prevent unrest.

Comment,"> terawatt of fusion

I’m all in favor of the overall vision you describe, but fusion is not going to help us achieve that. We have yet to even prove it’s possible to get more power out of a controlled fusion reaction than we put into it. 

Anyone reading this who thought that they recently read otherwise has been duped by the weasel words the industry uses, and by the media that’s more interested in reporting something exciting than reporting something true.

 Realistically, we’re at least 50 years away from commercially viable fusion power, but there’s a high chance we’ll never achieve it at all.",2023-11-11T17:14:16,goj1ra,1,Comment,https://www.yahoo.com/news/ukraine-energy-minister-floats-potential-184211634.html

You start escalating and Russia doesn't really have much farther to climb before they're using nukes, as they've already committed all their known arms and armaments to the front, an they're just incompetent enough to use them.

As much as solar manufacturing inputs are in demand, fossil fuels are also getting scarcer.  Solar doesn't need to be ""cheap"" to win in absolute terms.  It really only needs to be cheaper than the alternatives.

I do believe everyone aims for some type of republic structure with different states in a new and united Myanmar.

Comment,"I can't adjudicate the accuracy of reports, I can only address the issue.

I think it is reasonable to say that human shields are actively employed in this conflict.

There is an obligation from those who would not resort to such tactics to minimize the success of Hamas in augmenting civilian victims. 

Whether Israel is legitimately, thoroughly, and precisely engaging in that practice is incredibly difficult to tell from here. 

People are throwing around genocide, and while Netanyahu plus a large contingent with power in Israel would certainly like to see all the Palestinians move out of the area, that is not acceptable to its direct partners in the West, much less the international community.

And their tactics, while creating terror/grief/likely another generation or three of willing martyrs, do not resemble the intent of genocide.",2023-11-11T09:00:23,ILikeWatching,219,Comment,https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/idf-says-it-killed-hamas-commander-who-held-some-1000-gazans-hostage-at-hospital/

Cultures filled with beautiful women and children can bring art, food, life.

Refugees, POC, and migrants are not the enemy. They are a culture apart, yes, but they are not worthless. They are not the other.

Palestinians and Israelis are brothers. Peaceful resistance and protest are the way. Lay down your arms and dispel religion and animosity.

The question is this. If Hamas was holed up in a hospital in Israel, do you think that the IDF would be so blasé about bombing that hospital?

Honest question.

Comment,"it won't be better for gaza to be ruled by the palestinian authority. It's a fallacy that a people will treat their own people best. If gaza is taken over by israel or the UN they'll be better off. Israel has a strong military and economy so they have the means to control gaza, plus they border the region, so they can have better logistical control. It won't cost Israel to police it because UN aide goes into gaza regardless. 

Just now it won't get stolen by hamas. Israel can make sure it goes to the intended purpose. Improving humanitarian conditions instead of creating bombs and enriching hamas oligarchs. There's more ability for accountability in how israel is using UN aide. It's more likely to get to the residents because we have a relationship with them that we didn't with hamas. If the aide isn't improving the conditions then it gets pulled. 

Which would mean they have to pay for the security, but at the very least any aide flowing into the gaza strip will no longer be funneled into terror. The area can no longer be used as proxy by iran, russia, or any other actors. It's good for their national security that they govern the area. It's security jobs for their residents.

Sadly hostages are deceased. Hamas need to be decimated. The situation that has been festering for many years needs to be wholely dismantled. The only way to do it is to show the Palestinians that they will and can be totally defeated.

At that time, Hamas ran on the platform and was perceived by Palestinians as change to widespread corruption under Fatah. Since then, Israel has restricted and/or refused freedom of movement to members of the PLC, which prevented them from attending sessions which presumably could be used to hold new elections.

For context to your comment, it's estimated that the average age in Palestine is 18, meaning most living Palestinians would not have voted in the 2006 election.",2023-11-11T11:24:48,janas19,36,Comment,https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/idf-says-it-killed-hamas-commander-who-held-some-1000-gazans-hostage-at-hospital/

Comment,"Good question. My answer is that it depends. 

If Hamas would have got control of a city in Israel and started bombing Israel from all over the city, creating weapons, etc, while the citizens refuse to evacuate, and Hamas blending with the citizens, and IDF doesn’t know which one is a terrorist, Israel would not have any choice but to try to destroy Hamas while minimizing the civilians death, including bombing hospitals. Let’s consider that city has traps all over waiting, Why not just try to rescue the people in ground invasion, and refuse to bomb? Because it will cause massive amount of soldiers death (by the thousands), it will drastically lower morale and make the war almost impossible to win.

But if Hamas just had control of only one hospital, than the damage they can do with in it isn’t drastic, and you can easily surround the hospital and try different strategies to get the citizens out.

Your question also implies that Israel doesn’t have any problem of bombing a hospital with all of the civilians in it, and it isn’t really the case. Under the hospitals in Gaza, there are the main HQs of Hamas. Israel can just destroy the entire hospitals with all the people inside it, but doesn’t. Instead, they are trying to conquer the area and force the citizens to evacuate.

Comment,"Yes I wish Hamas wasn’t using human shields. Fuck Hamas, I hope they all die. 
But that doesn’t mean I don’t blame Israel for so many civilian deaths and wish that Israeli military killed less children and civilians. Because they are a proper military force from a democratic country and not a terrorist force like Hamas. A terrorist force using human shields does not give anyone a blank cheque to kill all those shields anyway. Israel can and should find better ways to destroy and kill Hamas while minimizing civilian casualties. 
And don’t tell me they can’t. We all know that if Hamas had managed to dig their tunnels under Israeli settlements in west bank, the response of Israeli military would not be to bomb those settlements killing civilians (in this case Israeli citizens) claiming they were human shields. Instead they would find ways to evacuate civilians and fight Hamas in their tunnels while doing their absolute best to minimize civilian casualties. Whereas in Gaza Israeli military has done a terrible job of avoiding civilian collateral damage which is evident from 10k civilians including around 4k children dead.

That why the loss of innocent lives need to minimized. For that Hamas needs to be destroyed while everyone doing their level best to minimize collateral damage.

Comment,">Are the 8000 parents also good riddance when they try to avenge their killed children?

It would be just as wrong for them to kill Israeli children as it would have been for Israel to kill their children.

Maybe.

There's some nuance in how wrong it is when civilians die as a result of engaging a military target. Hamas is hiding military locations and assets among civilians, which can put the fault on Hamas if those civilians die due to Israel's targeting of those locations and assets.

Obviously Israel should do everything they can to avoid as many civilian casualties as possible, but that doesn't mean they have to leave actual military targets alone.",2023-11-11T09:32:40,Cl1mh4224rd,8,Comment,https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/idf-says-it-killed-hamas-commander-who-held-some-1000-gazans-hostage-at-hospital/

Comment,"You are responding to my question with a completely different situation. And have also immediately gone to the argument that everyone with no argument goes to in these situations. ‘But what about what they did?’

Read the article. The key piece is that these Gazans were “prevented” from leaving. Let alone the fact that most people in any hospital can’t just ‘evacuate’.

They were hostages as is stated multiple times. 

So do I think that the Israeli population in general do not value the lives of Palestinians? Of course not. Neither of these people are a monolith. However, the current  Israeli government isn’t exactly showing themselves to be measured or proportionate. 

And to my original question. I think that if those hostages were Israeli, the response would be much different. You are free to believe differently, but I haven’t heard anything so far that would change my mind.

I will say this, I have no experience as a person with any kind of persecution or anything close to what anyone in this has experienced, so of course I’m watching this from the outside.

Comment,"I definitely think that the bombing of Dresden and the fire bombing of Tokyo were wrong yes. I also think the uses of the Atomic bomb (the second one certainly) were not justified. Along with the bombing of London and other cities.

And if they had happened after the signing of the Geneva convention, they would have most assuredly been in violation of that agreement.

What is your point? 

Again, this odd need to bring up the actions of other countries in history to justify what is happening at this point in time is baffling. 

I don’t trust the details being provided by either the Israeli government or any Hamas controlled organization, but I do trust Doctors Without Borders and other independent organizations that have said that a lot of these hospital targets are not in fact being used by Hamas.

It is undeniably horrible what Hamas did on Oct 7th. But that does not make the current situation any less horrible or avoidable. 

Just as Hamas made a poor calculation about Israel’s response and is no friend of the Palestinian people, the Israeli government is doing all its citizens (and by extension Jews around the world) a disservice by continuing to double down on this campaign.

Comment,">“Colonization is the answer, we can’t let these lessers govern themselves”

This shouldn't be such a controversial sentiment. It worked in Germany and it worked in Japan.

Denying that some cultures are better than others is denying that we have made progress in our own societies. We have a much better understanding of racism and bigotry than we did even a decade ago thanks to BLM and LBGTQ2S+ movements. We've been confronting our understanding of sexual assault thanks to metoo.

Some cultures are still stuck on medieval concepts which lead to sadistic massacres, the likes of which we saw on October 7th. Some cultures produce groups like ISIS. Look at what Russia is doing in Ukraine.

Yes, sometimes occupation is necessary. Not all occupations are examples of ""colonization"".

Comment,"you're partially correct in that they havent voted for them..
i wont go into depth (i recommend reading polls by PCPSR, an independent, uniased palestinian surveying organization), but support for hamas has been steadily rising among the population because of a few reasons, one of which the fact that hamas has embedded itself in the gazan culture (schools, universities, workplaces), and overall theres a rise in gazan support for armed militias, and a decrease in pro two state ideologies.
in PCPSR's works you can also find a recent joint survey (israelis and palestinians) which shows the differences in perspectives on topics like war, peace, etc that would further suggest hamas has had big influence on the way palestinian percieve israel",2023-11-11T13:14:00,fawlen,10,Comment,https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/idf-says-it-killed-hamas-commander-who-held-some-1000-gazans-hostage-at-hospital/

Comment,"If terrorists seized control of your country's government, what would happen?  Seriously, what would happen?

That would entirely depend on the citizens, right?  If the public was 100% in support of the terrorists, nothing would happen at all - and if the public was 100% against the terrorists, an uprising would immediately happen and the terrorists would be dead, right?

So, it's some kind of sliding scale.  At some level of support, terrorists are allowed to exist in control of the government, and below that level of support, they are not.  We just don't know exactly what the percentage is.

I'd argue that it's not simply 50%.  If as little as 10 or 20% of a population were against the terrorists, they'd easily be able to win a fight.  It's their home - and they can use insurgent/guerilla tactics, which is a huge force-multiplier.  If you're American and terrorists took control of the country, don't you think that 30 to 60 million citizens could take it back?  Actually, far fewer than 10 or 20%, right?  Maybe as little as 1 or 2% right?

Putting this all together...  

From the above, we know that terrorists can't really take control of an entire country - unless almost the entire population supports the terrorists.  Like, you need almost everyone to support the terrorists - or there would be a fight that the terrorists couldn't possibly win and they'd be gone.

Terrorists have control of Gaza and have had control of it for a long, long time.  

Given all that we've agreed to above, what does that tell you about the level of Gazans' support for Hamas?",2023-11-11T14:38:52,ClosPins,2,Comment,https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/idf-says-it-killed-hamas-commander-who-held-some-1000-gazans-hostage-at-hospital/

Or do they wipe Hamas out and try to make peace with the innocent Palestinians who remain?

The fact that Hamas uses civilian shields does not change that calculus, because it's a war crime and only shows the amount of civilian death Hamas is willing to accept to further it's goals, and the sheer risk for Israelis, that if Hamas will kill its own, what would they do with their enemies??

But there is plenty of documented stuff where Israel decided to undermine any viable leadership, and this is a mistake, because then you end up with the craziest bastards in charge.

Another pair of mistakes is to just sit by while Gaza sits in limbo (with no hope of any resolution for Gazans), and the West Bank's integrity is destroyed by asshole settlers who definitely don't represent most Israelis.

Comment,"> Is there a documented evidence of using human shield

Plenty. Right now, you're literally in a thread about a commander that kept 1000 civilians around him (war crime), in a hospital that was simultaneously being used as a military base (another war crime), so that he couldn't be airstriked without also killing the civilians, and actively had his men kill any civilians that tried to evacuate the war zone (another war crime).

Hamas doesn't even deny any of this. The official line is that people should be happy that they can be used as human shields, because they'll go to heaven early if they are killed.",2023-11-11T12:15:24,m0rogfar,11,Comment,https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/idf-says-it-killed-hamas-commander-who-held-some-1000-gazans-hostage-at-hospital/

Comment,"Depends on the target value, so this number can go up and down.  The ""law"" just says that civilian collateral damage should be taken into account, it doesn't restrict you to only strike if you don't hit more than 5 or 10 people.  I had heard that for the US in the recent war the number was about 30, but others who know better may be able to correct me.  Seems high but that's why most nations keep their civilians away from front lines and areas of action, because they don't want them to become collateral damage.  

So the real answer is the lowest number that achieves the valid military objectives in question.  If that number is 11,000 then the number you are looking for is 11,000.

Comment,"It's the trolley problem in philosophical ethics.  There is no right answer, just a choice that will be right based on perspective.

A trolley is on a track and will kill someone you know( your child) or you can switch tracks to save your child but it will kill 3 people you don't know?

What would you choose?  I think most people will save their child and thats an acceptable answer for a parent.  However, for outsiders looking in they criticize the choice as choosing to kill 3 to save 1 or dont even consider the 1

Isreal is choosing to save their children and own people (switching the track).   There is  inevitably collateral damage of that choice in civilian deaths on the other side.

Comment,"Hamas is to be blamed, but you can’t just level a hospital full of civilians because Hamas leader is hiding inside.

To put it bluntly, there is an acceptable level of collateral. Modern weapons have been designed to limit collateral. We no longer carpet bomb, fire bomb, and nuke cities just to eliminate a few military targets.

Hamas hides among civilians such that even modern weapons have a hard time limiting collateral. 

The big issue people have with the IDF is the early bombing campaign was above level of acceptable collateral (e.g. knowingly bombing dozens of civilians just to get one Hamas leader is kind of frowned upon).

Comment,"I never said a war with no civilian casualties. There always are. My point was that people’s expectations and tolerance for civilian casualties as well as the Israeli military’s response would be vastly different if Hamas had managed to dig their tunnels under Israeli settlements in west bank and it were their own civilians on the line. Then they wouldn’t be killing thousands of civilians and children with justification that those people were being used by Hamas as human shields.

Of course I don’t expect Israeli military to go to the same extent to protect Gazan civilians as they would go to protect their own civilians. No country and military in the world would do that.

Neither Hamas nor Israel gives 2 shits about the Palestinians. That is the problem. Claims that Hamas, a terrorist organization, would protect the Palestinians are wild. Israel knows that they won’t, and use that as an excuse to commit atrocities. “We told the Gazans to flee South with a 24 hour heads up”. Okay, but they’re getting shot by Hamas on the evacuation routes. So your options are to die by getting shot by Hamas trying to escape, or die in an Israeli air strike. What a choice. And we all know that if it was Hamas in tunnels under places like Tel Aviv, Israel would never bomb their own people and claim that it’s a casualty of war.

Comment,"It can actually be a war crime by both, in certain circumstances. 

Article 8(2)(b)(iv) of the Rome Statute. Also known as Principle of Proportionality under IHL. 

>Intentionally launching an attack in the knowledge that such attack will cause incidental loss 
of life or injury to civilians or damage to civilian objects or widespread, long-term and severe 
damage to the natural environment which would be clearly excessive in relation to the concrete 
and direct overall military advantage anticipated;

This applies, even if the enemy is using Human shields. It always applies. In every scenario. It is a Jus Cogens law. Preremptory norm, from which no deviation is allowed under any circumstances.

Using human shields is always a war crime too, obviously. As is taking hostages.

Few other ""favourites"" of mine:

>Extensive destruction and appropriation of property, not justified by military necessity and 
carried out unlawfully and wantonly;

>Attacking or bombarding, by whatever means, towns, villages, dwellings or buildings which are 
undefended and which are not military objectives;

>The transfer, directly or indirectly, by the Occupying Power of parts of its own civilian population 
into the territory it occupies, or the deportation or transfer of all or parts of the population of 
the occupied territory within or outside this territory;

Edit: I know that laws are such an inconvenience, but I didn't make them. So why am I getting downvoted? You can deny reality all you want, but it won't change the laws.

Also, to the dude that blocked me before I could answer their comment, that law applies to all strikes, individually. It has nothing to do with casualty per missile ratios or some such. Each strike is considered individually. Not all strikes violate said law. But there are some that may have, and should be investigated as potential war crimes.

It's a common misconception that it is about the overall war, but no. It is about each individual military action taken. What you are thinking is probably more along the lines of the Caroline Test from customary international law, about the proportionality of preemptive self-defence. This war with Hamas passes the first requirement of that test with flying colours, the instant and overwhelming necessity. The second requirement...

FYI, so far Israel dropped over 6000 missles and mortars. 10,000 innocents (at least that's what Hamas claims) died. It's definitely horrible - i'm not saying that a civilian death is a good thing, but if you do the math - it's 1.4 civilian per missle.

Doesn't that just tell you that you are predisposed? You don't believe the numbers that Hamas' itself is giving out, who most definitely skews it in their favour, and the UN's... it must be even more according to you?

Comment,"> If the IDF says boo the press just runs with it.

I see the exact opposite. Some news sources havent even retracted that attack on hospital blaming of Israel (even after Israel provided the footage proof). But the number of 500 (which was reported as 1000 by some sources) was not contested at all. 

1/3 of Americans do not believe that 07/10 took place. What would be the reason for that?

> I'm going to guess that 10k is an under count.

Please do not spread your uneducated guesses as facts. The next person who reads this going to say ""I heard that they killed much more than 10k"".. unless you have some relevant experience of course. No, Tiktok is not it.

> They've been bombing Gaza for weeks.

They have asked people to evacuate, using ""tap on roof"" protocol and using precision bombing on points of interest. What is the percentage of civilian casualties in such cases usually (difficult to say as no other army is using similar tactics to avoid civilian casualties)…? Do you have such info and can share it?

> So are you happy...

WTF is this dishonest rhetorics? Anybody said anything about being happy? Any reasonable person is not happy about any innocent Palestinian life loss. On the other hand it is perfectly reasonable to be happy about Israeli innocent life loss. According to your rhetoric I assume you will not be able to unconditionally condemn 07/10. Will you?

>If your goal simply was to wipe out Hamas you're not doing a very good job of it. 

IDF (not ""you"" but Israeli Defence Force) is actually doing a pretty good job since their original fuckup. The rocket attacks on Israel almost stopped which means Hamas is in defence mode. Moreso, Hamas offered to release 10 hostages for a seize fire and fee days later they offered 50. Which means they feel the pressure. But IDF is aiming to hurt Hamas in such way that will prevent them from gaining power in Gaza ever again, which is the best scenario both for Gaza and Israel.

Comment,"Sounds like we both agree Palestine needs to be freed from Hamas. Yes, many Israelis were not very sympathetic to gazans after watching them parade corpses in the street while women and children spat on them. Go figure. 

Believe what you want, but Israel is attacking precise locations where Hamas is active, where they are launching rockets, and where they are stockpiling weapons. Hamas does this as close to civilians as possible. This isn’t just an empty talking point it’s a very fucked up reality. So Israel sends notice before bombing and uses their military to protect civilians while they flee south. Their priority is their own citizens, like every military in the world, but they are absolutely trying to minimize casualties. If they weren’t the death toll would be 100k+ by now. 

Having Israel suspend military operations because Hamas is killing Palestinians is a ridiculous and naive notion. This is war. Israel is fighting this war so that tens and hundreds of thousands on both sides don’t have to keep dying because of these terrorists.

Comment,"This only applies to clearly excessive civilian casualties, which from the low casualty to missile ratio does not seem to be a hurdle that was cleared. There is a significant advantage to the safety of Israel and the foreign nationals who come there in dismantling the rocket sites and tunnels. The law is clear about the right to respond when military targets are embedded into civilian infrastructure. Hamas launches rockets from schools and builds tunnel entrances under children's beds. They use kid's backpacks to transport explosives. Maybe if far left protesters scream genocide enough they can gaslight us all into believing it was, but it doesn't seem possible to prove this was excessive, especially with the overwhelming amount of time and personnel devoted to helping civilians evacuate the area of conflict.

I predict a reply about child casualties that doesn't realize they're counting their underage soldiers in those totals. Why else do the deaths skew heavily male from 12-17? Indiscriminate killing would look more Indiscriminate.

Comment,"You're right, i guess bombing a missle lauch site, aimed at civilian cities, or taking out Terrorist leaders based in hospitals because civilian casualties happen immediately makes it an excessive and non proportional strike.

People like you would be asking for a cease fire during WWII because of the disproportionate deaths of British and American citizens vs. German.

In the context of international armed conflicts, this rule is set forth in the Third Geneva Convention (with respect to prisoners of war), the Fourth Geneva Convention (with respect to protected civilians) and Additional Protocol I (with respect to civilians in general).[1] Under the Statute of the International Criminal Court, “utilizing the presence of a civilian or other protected person to render certain points, areas or military forces immune from military operations” constitutes a war crime in international armed conflicts.[2]


Israel is doing everything in its power to make sure civilians are not killed. They are roof knocking, they have a humanitarian corridor for evacuation that they protect from HAMAS trying to murder its own fleeing civilians. The evacuation of these areas is also the responsibility of the ruling government, ie HAMAS. 

HAMAS refuses to evacuate citizens and then kills those leaving. That's a war crime. They had the responsibility to protect their own citizens, but they decided to dig up their water pipe to fire at civilian cities and send millions in aid to their leaders sitting pretty on qatar. 

Then they want to play the victim and say that israel has been occupying the land for 75 years and genociding its people. Israel hasnt been in control of Gaza for 75 years. it was in the control of Egypt in 1967. 

 Jews in the region have been under attack even before Israel was founded. Such as the Arab riots and 1929 Hebron Massacre. The land here was bought legally from other Arab land owners. Either that or jews were in cities that they had been in for millenia or settled in new lands covered in malaria ridden swamps. Jews that came here illegally were put in refugee camps by the british.

Now Israel has been here for 75 years and won many defensive wars against aggressive arab neighbors who dont believe Jews or Israel should exist.

Comment,"Proportionality directly refers to the collateral damage to the citizenry weighed against the *conferred military advantages* of the action.  It does *not* refer to killing only as many civilians as militants.  It doesn't refer to killing only as many of them as they have killed of your side.  It doesn't say that each commander on the other side is worth 5 casualties, or 10, or 5000.  There is no concrete guideline to proportionality to be found.

With this said, the only way to evaluate whether there's a war crime is to know what the military value of each strike target is.  And note this isn't an objective criteria, by nature it's going to exist only in the strategy rooms of the people doing the striking.  So if you can tell me what the value of each strike is, given that it's a pretty closely held secret...well, I don't know why Netanyahu is on Reddit when he's apparently got a war to run.  Maybe after this action is over everybody can go over each of the bombs and determine whether it was worth it, but I think Israel has at least been providing some sort of justification for each strike.  They just think that the civilian casualties are worth it, compared to future terror attacks against their people.

What this does call out as an obvious war crime is any strike (you are right, it goes by the individual action) where no military purpose can be discerned, such as an attack on a music festival with no obvious military targets in sight.  And as long as Hamas refuses to wear uniforms and mixes themselves in with the populous, they basically open up the entire population to at least some level of proportionate attacks.",2023-11-11T15:03:20,yikes_itsme,1,Comment,https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/idf-says-it-killed-hamas-commander-who-held-some-1000-gazans-hostage-at-hospital/

Comment,"Well... then how would you handle the current problem? You can't just sit back and let the rockets fall on cities in Israel (Yes, Hamas is still firing rockets daily and Iron Dome doesn't catch all). If you now pull back Hamas (the leaders) will see it as a weakness, rearm, regroup and repeat Oct 7th as soon as they can since it was a success after all. You might not be able to fully eradicate them, but you can seriously weaken them, especially destroy their infrastructure and weapons caches.

'Fighting the culture of extremism'. Sounds nice. How? I don't mean in general, I mean down there.

Gaza could have been a much nicer place, but Hamas had to spend the international aid money on weapons and building tunnels instead of improving the live of the citizens.

After Hamas took power that leader, not being internationally recognized, aligned themselves with Iran and became much more extreme and ruthless.  He gained financial and military support from Iran as reward, and started the best anti-Israeli PR campaign on the planet, using the Palestinian's self-inflicted misery and pointing at Israel as the source so they could get away with any and all ruthlessness to both Israelis and their own people.

Comment,"It’s the role of public to raise questions and highlight issues and the relevant industry professionals to come up with answers or solutions. When a disaster happens e.g. a dam collapse, the public will protest or raise questions and the civil engineers / safety experts will come up with answers and how to do better next time. 

Since I am not a military expert or commander, I cannot answer your question regarding what better methods can Israeli military employ to minimize civilian deaths. But that doesn’t mean I should not raise questions or demand they figure out a way to do better. I am sure there are brilliant minds in Israeli military who can come up with far better answers than I could, if they had the will to do so and if they viewed the current civilian death toll as too high.

All I am saying is that while many people and Israeli military see 10,000 Gazan civilian deaths as an acceptable cost to destroy Hamas as these people are being used as human shields. But if the situation was reversed and it was 10,000 Israeli settlers in west bank being used as human shields by Hamas then the same people and Israel military would never tolerate that as an acceptable cost to destroy Hamas. Even 1/4th a number would have a public outcry.
There would be far greater public pressure and will inside Israeli military to use their genius to figure out better solutions to minimize civilian deaths.

This doesn’t mean that I expect Israeli military to place an equal value on their own civilian’s life vs a foreign civilian. That would not be realistic or fair.

Comment,">Israel is doing everything in its power to make sure civilians are not killed.

Okay. Then Israel gets to prove it in a Court of Law. Specifically, ICC, since they have jurisdiction in Gaza. 

>In the context of international armed conflicts, this rule is set forth in the Third Geneva Convention (with respect to prisoners of war), the Fourth Geneva Convention (with respect to protected civilians) and Additional Protocol I (with respect to civilians in general).[1] Under the Statute of the International Criminal Court, “utilizing the presence of a civilian or other protected person to render certain points, areas or military forces immune from military operations” constitutes a war crime in international armed conflicts.[2]

You are aware it doesn't stop there? There are a lot more laws to warfare than just the Geneva Conventions. You may wanna read through the rest of IHL. 

The rest of your comment is irrelevant to the topic at hand.

I seriously don't care about your opinions. I am simply explaining the law, since you seem to have some misconceptions about it.

I will say this tho. 

>Then they want to play the victim and say that israel has been occupying the land for 75 years and genociding its people. Israel hasnt been in control of Gaza for 75 years. it was in the control of Egypt in 1967.

Comment,"I know I'm not the person you asked, but I'll throw my answer out there. 

I would take them out, but I wouldn't then also kill their family, their friends, their neighbors, their co-workers, etc. Hamas is objectively in the wrong, but that doesn't suddenly make all actions by Israel correct. For example, if Israel is found to have been using White Phosphorous against Palentinians, since it is kind of hard to use it as a precision weapon, then I will lose all sympathy for the Israeli government. They are a government, not a terrorist organization, and thus have to be held to a high standard. If we don't, we are all screwed.

After WW2, Jewish surivivors wanted to poison the water supply of Berlin, leading to the potential deaths of thousands of civilians. Can I ask you, after everything that happened in WW2, do you think that would be ok?

To sum things up using an analogy, if I had a kid, and that kid was severely bullied by someone else (let's say the bully broke my kid's arm). Personally, if that bully is not properly reprimanded by the school or adults, I think there can be somewhat of a justification for my kid retaliating and breaking the bully's arm. What I personally wouldn't be ok with is if my kid broke not only his bully's arm, but the arm of everyone that the bully knows, and everyone they know, and so on.",2023-11-11T10:20:35,TheBrownEvilPig,-7,Comment,https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/idf-says-it-killed-hamas-commander-who-held-some-1000-gazans-hostage-at-hospital/

Comment,">Bombing a location has a pretty high risk to civilian life. It is against the Geneva convention to target civilians. 

It's against the Conventions to target them specifically.

>There's no ""fair game"" clause

There literally are. Several clauses state that civilian casualties are acceptable if the level of force is proportional to the target.

>Unless you're suggesting if a plane is hijacked in future (on the ground) the acceptable response is to blow the plane up.

To make that analogy work, the plane would have to be hijacked by enemy combatants in a warzone and transformed into a weapons installation or command post. In which case, yes, it is acceptable to blow it up.

I'm curious: in your world, how do you imagine Israel counterattacking? Hamas invades, summarily executes over a thousand civilians of no military relevance in close quarters, then runs back behind their border. They then proceed to pile civilians around their facilities and continue launching missiles. According to you, they just get to say ""Nuh uh, there are civilians nearby, you've gotta let us bomb you.""",2023-11-11T09:18:49,GooeyPig,28,Comment,https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/idf-says-it-killed-hamas-commander-who-held-some-1000-gazans-hostage-at-hospital/

Is there any more recent evidence? Backing hamas in the 80's as a counter to the PLO is pretty different from directly funding them more recently. 

Also for people criticizing Israel for ""funding"" hamas what is your alternative? Stop allowing aid into Gaza?

The 2 main arguments I've seen for Israel propping up hamas is allowing aid into Gaza which ends up funding hamas, and not doing more to eradicate them sooner which would have required what we're seeing now (bombings and ground troops in Gaza) and historically every time they've gone after hamas the international community starts condemning them.",2023-11-11T14:02:40,Musiclover4200,32,Comment,https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/idf-says-it-killed-hamas-commander-who-held-some-1000-gazans-hostage-at-hospital/

Comment,"Honestly, I think this is one of the reasons why the Israel-Palestinian conflict is so misunderstood.

First, most of us do not live under that kind of oppression.  We just don't.  Even with the corruption that many of us may see in our own governments, none of that corruption comes anywhere *close* to the degree of corruption that Hamas has over their own people

No matter what issues I have with the US government, I at least know that I am safe, that I have food in the house, and that the government isn't going to sacrifice me as a human shield.  I can have a ""fuck desantis"" party all day long - but I also know that he's not gonna come into my house and blow my head off.

second - because most of us also, do not live in a country that is constantly under the threat of such terrorism, from another country.  They don't live in circumstances where their own country has to ante up the intelligence and security, to the point of out-doing a terrorist organization, because all they see is a power imbalance where one guy is more powerful, and the other is an underdog.

None of this is easy. Civilians have and will die. But that doesn't mean we can't act to minimize loss of life. Special forces exist for a reason. Israel has them for a reason. My tax dollars pay for their equipment, supposedly for a reason.

It will be extremely dangerous for those special forces. But they signed up for danger, they are trained to deal with it. Part of the reason it will be so dangerous is because Israel has forced so many people into such a small area. That's just reality. It doesn't mean the IDF are only left with murdering civilians.

You do see Israel using Special forces Raids in Areas that are Semi-Permissive like the west bank where Israel has some control, but Gaza is totally non-permissive. You could send 100 Special Forces Raids into Gaza City over 5 years and you would have a 100% casualty rate with zero success.

It's reasonable to criticize Israel for funding them, and also to criticize Israel for then using their existence of the group they created as a reason to attack and take land from Palestinians.

I'm not out here saying Hamas is good, I'm saying Israel never should have funded a violent terrorist group to divide Palestine, and now is facing the consequences. It's not that oh Hamas should have used that money on infrastructure, the goal of getting that money wasn't to raise infrastructure and Israel knew and expected that when giving it to them.

Comment,"There is a growing uranium supply deficit that is becoming bigger the further we look out to/past 2030.  It takes a few years to go from mined u308 to fabricated fuel rods so best to secure supply now. 

 China is building reactors at a fast pace - using the same blueprints for each reactor as opposed to the Western practice of building very expensive one-off reactors that are each designed from the ground up.  Many other countries are realizing nuclear is a great carbon free baselode power and starting their own buildout programs.

The US doesn't have any huge uranium mines (not even in development).  Canada has Cameco which will eventually use up its easiest/best deposits.  Developers like NexGen, Denison, and Fission have great deposits but they are years away and can't supply all of NA.  Kazakhstan has Kazatomprom but they are mostly selling to China and Russia.  Namibia has Paladin and two good developers (Bannerman and Deep Yellow) and Australia has one mine about to reopen (Boss).  Niger traditionally had French companies mining but their mines were depleted.  This new company (Global Atomic) is actually a Canadian company and has a very economical deposit.

Comment,"As opposed to France, which imported huge amounts of Nigerien uranium until recently. The ruling junta, which recently performed a coup against the democratically elected government, is opposed to French troops in Niger and is banning the export of uranium to France. They're pro-Russian and the Wagner group has already moved in to the country following the coup.

America swooping in to buy up all that uranium is actually a good thing - there's not many Western countries that are friendly with the current Nigerien government and there's a real risk that some of this uranium would end up getting sold by Wagner in black markets worldwide. This could be a non-violent way to pull Niger out of Russian influence and back towards the West.",2023-11-11T09:13:18,OnlyHeStandsThere,2,Comment,https://greeninvesting.co/2023/11/biden-administration-to-fund-uranium-mine-in-africa/

Comment,Yes but most of the deposits and grades are far below what's found in the Athabasca basin up in Canada.  The economics of building a mine for only 10 or 20 million pounds of uranium can't compare to the economics of a 200m lb+ deposit.  This mine in Niger is huge and high grade - and unsurprisingly the labour costs are far below that of say Canada or US.,2023-11-11T12:41:56,reginaccount,2,Comment,https://greeninvesting.co/2023/11/biden-administration-to-fund-uranium-mine-in-africa/

If so (as I read it) any intervention would end you up somewhere akin to the situation in Afghanistan, where the local government only last as long as direct military support does, and you don't have the home front stamina to stay there long enough to build something lasting (nevermind the colonial aspects of that).",2023-11-11T09:26:36,Dinosaur_taco,28,Comment,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/10/un-warns-violence-against-civilians-in-sudan-verging-on-pure-evil

Not exactly a ""You're not Arab, therefore genocide"" situation, more of ""Your fighters rebelled against us, therefore genocide"". Like, it's still genocide, but it's hardly as ""Arab vs Non-Arab"" that things get simplified to.

One might find similarities between this and the Uyghur genocide, in which the Uyghurs aren't being genocided for being Uyghurs (or Muslim), but because they have a notable fighter base that is/was fighting the central government in some form....only in this case, the RSF is jumping straight to 'murder' instead of 're-education'.",2023-11-11T18:51:30,HouseOfSteak,9,Comment,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/10/un-warns-violence-against-civilians-in-sudan-verging-on-pure-evil

Comment,"amnesty International, the Campaign Against the Arms Trade, and STW asked people to contribute to a correspondence campaign to parliament, crowdfunding a legal campaign to block U.K. export licences to Saudi Arabia, and rather than organising London protests, target arms factories specifically with direct protest, which many thousands have. It’s been one of the more effective coordinated direct campaigns of the last 20 years. The campaign already achieved the courts blocking export licences for nearly a year, and are trying again for another court hearing for a fresh export ban.

Classic case of “well I, a person who doesn’t care, haven’t heard about it, so nobody can be doing anything”

It does play a part for some, especially the ones chanting, well, you know. But you also gotta know a large part will always be the ""Peace no matter what"" crowd and also those who've been protesting Israel's actions in Gaza since 2008. This stuff ain't new. 

Antisemitism plays a part. No doubt. Not even going to disagree. But there have been heaps of protesting in the past due to Israel's (under Netty wankface) actions. 

> Relative to other conflicts (ongoing or from the past), that number is small, and on those you didn't see this magnitude of protest (not even close).

There was 36 million people protesting against Iraq war.

You should read up on the history of, well, everything. It far different than what you will read on what jpost and stuff.

No. Just... No. IDF don't give a fuck about civilian casualties. They barely ever have and will never. Their past shows that and even their recent actions show that. Seriously. How can you say that line with a straight face. Lol.

That was the civilian deaths. And the whole Mosul area (not just the city) is the sameish for Gaza. But Mosul has a higher population at 3.7m. Where Gaza has a population of 2m.

Gaza has 6k per km2 in population density. Mosul has 5k per km2 in population density.

And no newspaper that I can see from reading up was saying that was an acceptable amount of civilian deaths. 

U.S supplies Israel that's why. 

And yet again, if you want to always say it's nothing but bigots then thats on you. Newspapers will always try go for clickbait articles that grab attention. But most of the protests you'll find aren't based on bigotry. There are bigots there, 100% not denying that.

Comment,"People who are busy fighting over the Israeli Palestinian conflict fail to see the bigger picture. This is a geopolitical conflict over control of energy, resources and power. 

On the one side you have Iran who is one of the biggest terrorist funders in the world, you have Russia who is a big ally of Iran and provides it with weaponry, and of course China who is also “discretely” aligning itself with the eastern power block as it faces off the US. We all know what these countries stand for and what values they uphold. 

On the other side you have the US and Europe who try to thwart Russian and Chinese influence over the area. Israel, an ally of the US, has been normalizing relations with Arab counties in the middle east which is unprecedented given the historical hostility between them. This is a direct threat to Iran, Russia, and China as it gives the West access to oil and gas and prevents their opponents from developing their own strategic interests. 

So what can Iran do to help? Start a war of course! And it does so using its proxies, Hamas and Hezbollah, without even having to send a single person of their own troops. Russia benefits greatly when the world’s attention shifts from the war in Ukraine to the Israel-Hamas war. In addition, the US has to redirect some of its attention and money to aid Israel. Iran turns the Arab world against Israel and thereby against the West. The normalization is halted while the war continues to destabilize the region. 

So what you should really ask yourself is who is benefiting from this war? What are their interests? And does anyone really care about the Palestinians, or are they sacrificing them cynically to antagonize Israel at every possible opportunity to achieve personal goals?",2023-11-11T07:10:08,JustaGuynamedGuy,310,Comment,https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/in-brussels-fm-cohen-says-iran-is-financing-hamas-to-stop-arab-countries-normalization-with-israel/

Comment,"The main reason for this war is ultimately IMEC, the India-Middle East-Europe corridor that is the US and the west's response to China's belt and road and Russia's Iran-North route. It was only announced in September, but would be a railroad, port, and other infrastructure construction stretching from India, through Qatar, the UAE, and Saudi Arabia, to Jordan and Isreal before shipping to Greece. This bypasses Iran, Pakistan, Iraq, and Turkey, and would severely hurt if not out cripple their economies. Not to mention the effects on China or Russia. 

However, the key of this plan is a normalization of relationships between Saudi Arabia and Israel. Which is exactly why Iran pushed their various proxies to do whatever it took to sideline the deal, except Hamas took it way to far. 

The good news is that once Hamas is dealt with, the IMEC plan can be slightly amended to include both the west bank and Gaza. If a Marshall type plan to rebuild Gaza is implemented as well, then if Hamas can be eliminated quickly, we might very well see peace, real peace, soon.",2023-11-11T10:20:30,karl4319,61,Comment,https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/in-brussels-fm-cohen-says-iran-is-financing-hamas-to-stop-arab-countries-normalization-with-israel/

Thats one reason why Iran (Shia) tries to disrupt the normalization of relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia (Sunni).",2023-11-11T10:12:50,heretic27,8,Comment,https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/in-brussels-fm-cohen-says-iran-is-financing-hamas-to-stop-arab-countries-normalization-with-israel/
Comment,"Iran controls the Strait of Hormuz, a global supply choke point for oil from the gulf states entering the global oil market. This gives Iran enormous geopolitical importance. Saudi Arabia has been looking to get around this effort by building pipelines to ports in its south and to the west. Except, every time they try, the country they attempt to partner with mysteriously falls into an internal conflict that makes this partnership impossible. Pipelines in Syria getting destroyed.

Israel and Saudi Arabia were normalizing relations so that eventually a pipeline running from Saudi Arabia, into Jordan and then landing in ports in Israel could be constructed, mutually benefiting all three. Israel and Jordan are relatively stable, so no worry for an ISIS type situation playing out there like in Syria.

_Except,_ Israel actually does have a huge source of internal strife that can be exploited, namely its conflict with the Palestinians and more specifically in this instance Hamas. Hamas already had ties to Iran, so it could act as an aggregator in Iran’s stead to destabilize Israel.

My personal opinion is that Israel’s plans moving forward in regards to Gaza will doom it to decades of occupation and resource drain, and while Iran might not succeed in halting Saudi/Israeli normalization, they very well might succeed in destabilizing Israel internally, with the probable 20 years of constant insurgent fighting they’re facing, the impossible goal of eliminating Hamas (ask the US how eliminating the Taliban went).",2023-11-11T18:06:54,fireblyxx,1,Comment,https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/in-brussels-fm-cohen-says-iran-is-financing-hamas-to-stop-arab-countries-normalization-with-israel/
Comment,"It’s more or less the job of the Israeli FM to do so lol.

Is Israel really stopping normalization though? 

FYI, at today’s emergency meeting of the Arab League, the following countries opposed or abstained important clauses in the proposed resolution: 

**Bahrain**, Comoros Islands, Djibouti, **Egypt**, **Jordan**, Mauritania, Morocco, **Saudi Arabia**, Somalia, Sudan, **UAE**.

The clauses included an oil embargo and the freezing of economic, security and military ties with Israel.

Hamas is an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood, an enemy of many Arab governments, and is supported by Iran, an enemy of many Arab countries.

The countries in the region, especially those who are normalizing (or have already done so) are extremely aware of this.",2023-11-11T07:24:48,immortal-the-third,8,Comment,https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/in-brussels-fm-cohen-says-iran-is-financing-hamas-to-stop-arab-countries-normalization-with-israel/

Comment,"The issue for Iran is that Israel and Saudi Arabia have both been the two big enemies of the Iranian regime since it became a religious dictatorship in 1979, but the two historically been completely unable to work together, because Saudi Arabia has been strongly opposed to Israel as well. If Israel-Saudi normalization go through, it's effectively an agreement that the two will make peace to focus on working together to undermine Iran in a much more effective way than has been possible before, which Iran obviously doesn't want.

For this reason, Iran has backed Hamas and started this conflict in hopes that Israel's counterattack will enrage Sunni Muslims in Saudi Arabia to the point where the government will be unable to proceed with normalization of relations with Israel. As part of the same strategy, they're also throwing out some crocodile tears for the Palestinian people, even though they don't care at all about them, and only see them as a tool to hurt Israel and Saudi Arabia.

It doesn't really seem to be working though. Israel's counterattack has had enough measures to avoid civilian casualties that the deal isn't off permanently due to public pressure, and Saudi leadership is certainly not going to be less worried about Iran when they have their proxies doing stuff like this. The Houthis, another Iranian proxy in Yemen that Iran is keeping around to potentially attack Saudi Arabia, could repeat something like this, and they've also started throwing ballistic missiles over Saudi airspace to hit Israel, and the Saudis are likely very worried about them having that capability as well.",2023-11-11T14:06:53,m0rogfar,3,Comment,https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/in-brussels-fm-cohen-says-iran-is-financing-hamas-to-stop-arab-countries-normalization-with-israel/

Comment,"Yeah, depending the amount of these tickets sold per flight and their route, the expense would be negligible.

Airlines have to fly their routes regardless of capacity, the only expense that changes is the fuel (weight changes) load -- so after a point, it doesn't matter if the seat is $300 or $3, the cost is fixed. It's why many give free flights to employees with seat availability. Often the goal is to get as many customers on the plane so they can have a better odds of monetizing them there (food, entertainment).",2023-11-11T12:31:17,VegasKL,10,Comment,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/china-southern-airline-tickets-glitch/index.html

Weird thing tho. The numbers from Hamas are smaller than the latest estimate from Israeli newspaper Ynet, which gives a number of 20000 for casualties in Gaza, citing some unnamed Senior Security official in Israel.

>On 4 November, an unnamed Israeli official claimed that around 20,000 people had been killed in Gaza, ""most of them terrorists."" 

[Here is the wiki I got it from.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_2023_Israel%E2%80%93Hamas_war)

The last part is obvious BS tho. Even in Afghanistan, the casualty ratio was 3 civilians to 1 Enemy, and Gaza has seen much more bombs in the last month than there was in Afghanistan during the year when the bombings were heaviest, and Gaza is much more densely populated, and Hamas I using Human shields.

It is more truthful to understand that jihadist Hamas has actually been OCCUPYING Gaza for years, with low regard for the residents who have become pawns and thus casualties if military action.

Comment,"Okay. Lets do some estimating, using history and some miscellaneous knowledge we currently have. 

During the war in Afghanistan, the casualty ratio was 3 civilians per 1 terrorist killed. Now, let's factor in that Gaza is much, much more densely populated, the fact that the bombing Gaza has seen is in the past month is so heavy, it puts literal years of war in Afghanistan to shame, and Hamas uses human shields. Then let's factor in the stuff like roof knocking, and evacuation orders, which many aren't listening to. 

The best case scenario estimate is 4 civilians per 1 Hamas member. And that is the absolute best case scenario. It is likely much, much worse.

I do have an idea how we can estimate total casualties, if you wanna hear about it. It's a bit... Iffy, at best, but it could work to give a rough realistic estimate. Just ask, if you are interested.

I am not gonna praise Israel for following international law for once. Especially in the context that Israel is in constant violation of international law, due to the West Bank settlements.

And you don't praise someone for doing the barest minimum required of them. And judging by the comments from the US, UN, ICRC, ICC and many, many other parties, even that is in question. 

I'll withhold judgement in the case of this war until someone whose job it is to judge these things actually finishes investigating, if they have followed the law or not. But I certainly won't praise them for following international law, even if it turns out they have in this case. Because that is literally required of them.

Not sure how well we can compare these two events, due to how different the scale of the response was... The intensity of the bombardment is on a whole other level now, when compared to then. And it isn't even considered a war, and the objectives of military operations were much more limited. But let's take it into consideration. 

During the few weeks those hostilities lasted, the death toll was just 260-ish. And now, in the same amount of time, thousands, according to every estimate, regardless who has made it. So clearly something has changed since then.

Comment,"At the moment the fissure opens there is significant danger.  There's a video of the last fissure opening in the middle of the tundra [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhEBsv_vaK4). The scale of pre-eruption measurements for this volcano is 10-100x higher so it could be more rapid and create a much longer fissure.  There's a possibility the fissure could be several miles (5-10 km) long, from north of the area all the way down into the ocean.  There is no certainty in any prediction though - scientists can make estimates based on past eruptions, but these events are too rare and random to know for sure.

Lava coming up under the lagoon would certainly cause boiling, but more likely the amount of lava will cause surface water to just flash to steam.  Any groundwater can become superheated without boiling due to the pressure of ground above, then when that pressure is released a large steam explosion (phreatic eruption) can happen.  This would obviously be very bad if anyone is at the lagoon at the time and warrants an evacuation, but I think the likeliest fissure area as of now does not cross the lagoon.  More likely is that the fissure cuts off direct access and then lava rivers would put the lagoon at risk afterwards.

The fissure coming up under the power plant would certainly destroy it, but again the expected fissure area does not cross this.  Last I heard they were building a dirt wall in front of it.  Iceland has a pretty good history of diverting lava - compared to the cost of rebuilding things it's quite cheap.

The path of the fissure does go right through the town, though, and that's where the biggest risk to life and property both happens.  The town was evacuated ~24 hours ago after measurements showed it had widened by about 4 feet (1.2 meters) in the most recent earthquake swarm, implying a massive movement of lava.  Typically fissures will just run in a straight line, so walking perpendicular will get you safely away.  But if the fissure comes up underneath a house then the area of peril is a lot bigger than it would be in the tundra.  The town almost certainly has groundwater which would risk phreatic explosions also.

Comment,"You sleep with terrorists, you can get hurt!

Enough protecting Hamas. They ARE a terror group  
NOT a government. 

The people that gave them the power ARE NOT SPEAKING OUT AGAINST THEM!!!

WHY NOT???

Why are they cheering on them to continue?
Why is the entire Arab world is supporting them?
Why are they not asking THEM to stand down?
Why not demanding they !!….

RELEASE THE GODDAMM HOSTAGES???

They wanted a response and they got it. 
You come to my house slaughtering 1400 people and what? You want box of chocolates?

They are calling and always have called for the destruction of the state of Israel, right?

Why?

Because they CALIM it’s their right!!
Why?

Because of one IMAGINARY FRIEND, right?

Right??

You want to kill a whole group of people because of your religion???

What??

Religion should be outlawed. 

They hate because of it. 

Their religion IS HATE!!

And by the way, they are the only people on the planet who are OK with their children as suicide bombers.

The plan? Simple the natives were getting restless and to avoid impropriety for top Hamas brass, turn the native loose. I am sure Putin had a hand in this. Why?

Comment,"There is absolutely no way of knowing with any real certainty. Both sides will put out numbers based on their agenda and a lot of it is just propaganda.

Also Hamas members aren’t all equal, what gets defined as an enemy combatant is going to be very subjective. Some are just Hamas supporters without any kind of real affiliation and then you have Hamas members that are trained and in contact and supported by the leadership to carry out acts on behalf of the group. 

Unfortunately they don’t carry around cards with the rank/affiliation and dead bodies aren’t very good at answering questions.

The real test to how successful Israel’s operations are is whether rocket attacks and resistance within Gaza subsides. But it’s going to be damn near impossible to accurately figure out the civilian vs Hamas casualty rate.",2023-11-11T06:40:28,test_test_1_2_3,200,Comment,https://www.business-standard.com/world-news/idf-gains-control-of-hamas-territory-in-northern-gaza-kills-150-terrorists-123111100052_1.html
Comment,"The combatants in Gaza do not wear any uniforms, they are civilians with weapons, you can see it clear as day in all the videos Hamas publishes himself

This is of course to counter any claim Israel might make of the number of combatants they kill and make them look like plain murderers, which always works

Even the 'Children' killed is unreliable, not only because it comes from Hamas's run ministry of health (and some people will make you believe it was fact checked but everyone uses the same source and its not like they never lied before or were caught faking the deaths of living people..) but because 'children' are counted as below 18, which is combat age, especially for Hamas which indoctrinates children to combat from kindergarden

There's no doubt many real non combatant children did die, probably the vast majority of them, just important to recognize the situation

The Ministry of Health also doesn't report on any dead combatants amongst its above 18 male population either, everyone are civilian only, even if you find some who were known members of Hamas military wing no one will admit it, eventually Israel will probably go over the list and 'expose' them and they will just be brushed off as propaganda

As for the numbers, we're around 11k dead in Gaza, 2800~ missing (under the rubble of buildings or underground tunnels are the main reasons), somewhere between 1000-1500 dead combatants that died inside Israel (from the original attack)

Israel is at 1200~ dead (down from 1400 as the current estimate is that **perhaps** 200 are dead Palestinian attackers, there are still many bodies unable to be identified), mostly civilians with about 330 of them being IDF/Police who were in the bases/vicinity of the attacks, 239 abductees and an additional 35~ KIA soldiers in Gaza since the start of the operation, additionally there are many thousands of injured and some killed from the continued rocket attacks (over 9500 so far)

Additionally, about 160~ Palestinians dead in the West Bank riots and attacks on civilians and security forces, 1000+ arrested (mostly Hamas affiliated), some of the dead are PA security forces joining combat against the IDF and a few Israeli civilians murdered by the aforementioned terror attacks

And finally, Israel is attacked by Hezbollah+Hamas from Lebanon and the Houtis from Yemen, this also led to some civilian+military casualties

Historically, IDF has claimed around 1:1 ratio civilian:combatant rate in its operations in Gaza, this is of course optimistic and cannot really be verified for all the aforementioned reasons but even if its half as accurate as they predict, it would still be a 'pretty good ratio' in military standards compared to other western military actions, I would assume the ratio is not as good this time around due to the intensity of the IDF retaliation but it will get better as time passes, as the IDF is managing to finally convince the Gazans to flee combat zones and they comply, which will reduce the amount of potential civilian casualties",2023-11-11T08:45:44,ShikukuWabe,29,Comment,https://www.business-standard.com/world-news/idf-gains-control-of-hamas-territory-in-northern-gaza-kills-150-terrorists-123111100052_1.html

>Thirty-two IDF soldiers have died since the ground invasion began. Though every one of those deaths is felt deeply within an already grieving Israeli society, that figure is far lower than anticipated.

Not sure how reliable the figures are, or how it has evolved since but it *seems* like the IDF is doing better than expected, especially considering that the whole point of the initial attack was to bait Israel into a ground invasion.

Comment,"If we're to use the data from previous operations, according to  B'Tselem (an ultra-leftist pro palestinian israeli org), the civilian casualty rate is around 56% (and in some operations has even reached over 68%).

According to Shin Bet, the civilian casualty rate is around 38%.
These things are unknown as of now, due to fog of war.

In modern warfare, 65% to 70% is the usual civilian casualty rate.

Casualty rates include all injuries (that require treatment. including mental trauma, as far as I'm aware) and deaths. Injuries are more common than death.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8581199/

150 terrorists in one specific operation is - a good thing (obviously).

The current reports are a bit problematic as well: since Hamas uses civilian outfits when they fight, they usually include their fighters in the civilian casualties.

In any case, we don't know much as of now, but now you can estimate that at least 3,000 to 4,000 Hamas members are dead.

Not sure if the Pali include the death of the 07/10 attackers in the casualty rate, but history suggests that they are indeed counted. But I'm too lazy and the current numbers are likely far below the actual numbers.",2023-11-11T09:27:51,Evil_Malloc,31,Comment,https://www.business-standard.com/world-news/idf-gains-control-of-hamas-territory-in-northern-gaza-kills-150-terrorists-123111100052_1.html

Comment,"> Arab countries have my full solidarity.

You would think that if there was solidarity between Arab countries that they would be pushing for peace. But that is not the case, there are many who have grown weary of the situation, and some which have become bi-partisian, the ones calling for the destruction of the Israel state are the ones who are contributing to the violence.

It alone accounted for half of the murders, many missing and a ""first degree of separation"" of evidence of the brutality from thousands of international survivors.

Even WITH that aspect of Oct 7th there's been incredible pressure on western govts to admonish Israel for its military actions.

It's tragic to think that were it 'just' the atrocities and slaughter in the kibbutz's, then Hamas would have gotten the exact scenario it planned for.

Yes, that means they implicitly accepted the losses of those hostages, which may seem cold-hearted, but eliminating Hamas could save many more in the long run.

Do you think Israel is going to hold off and let Hamas catch their breath? How do you think Israel will respond when another terrorist attack happens on their soil?

They are the one who started this conflict. 
They are the one who are refusing a 2 state solution.

Comment,"Absolutely, and so should you. ""Kills 150 terrorists"" is specifically tailored language to avoid people asking that question. 150 people are dead, but it's all okay because they were all terrorists anyway. Propaganda is propaganda, no matter how much everybody is downvoting me for calling it out or how sympathetic the group might be.

I've said it before and I'll say it again, there's no excusing Hamas, but when everything's all tallied up, there'll be no excusing some of the lows Israel has stooped to in this conflict, either.

EDIT: Just look at the scale, and look at the comparisons. 10 people means everybody in a room was taken out. 150 people means everybody in a decent-size building was taken out.

Comment,"Um. 

If you don't understand this then you are either deep into propaganda, or perhaps just very inexperienced with geopolitics. I'm not trying to be mean. But this is not really disputable. 

They were as brutal as possible, and as public as possible (livestreamed themselves slaughtering people to their social media, filmed themselves parading a dead/broken undressed young woman, literally published the videos themselves), to incite as much fear and rage as possible, to provoke Israel into the harshest response as possible. 

There were little/no military targeting in their attack. No strategic land gains. It was *terrorism.* It was about getting attention and provoking terror. 

The media coverage of the atrocities against Israel lasted a couple of weeks, but now that Israel has a long war effort against Gaza the media coverage of dead Gazans will lasts weeks/months. Further, Hamas is cloaking themselves in civilians and maximizing pain. 

Immediately along with the massacre of civilians on Oct 7, a social media misinformation campaign was launched and is continuing today. Russia and China have also joined the fun for reasons of their own (there was a NYT article about this). Twitter and Tiktok are an absolute cesspool of misinformation. A lot of bomb footage is actually old, from Syria. I'm sure you've seen the Palestine actor who has appeared in multiple roles in multiple propaganda videos? 

Hamas leaders themselves said ""we succeeded in getting the Palestine issue back on the table"" - that's a veiled way of saying, the world oriented at Palestine now, and public opinion turning against Israel.",2023-11-11T16:41:01,JoanofArc5,5,Comment,https://www.business-standard.com/world-news/idf-gains-control-of-hamas-territory-in-northern-gaza-kills-150-terrorists-123111100052_1.html

Comment,"You must have heard a report on a single strike. 200 is way too little.

IDF officials estimate that around 20,000 people have been killed in Gaza, most of them terrorists. According to them, the Gaza health ministry doesn't report casualties from hamas' tunnels because they're still buried deep underground.

The IDF estimates that between 50 and 100 hamas members are killed in every tunnel strike, this is the reason for the 20,000 dead estimation as opposed to hamas' 10,000.

I get your idea is ""Israel shouldn't have taken the bait"" and in a perfect world where the people of a nation wouldn't throw out a government that refuses to retaliate for this on it's ass, that's the ideal scenario. But since we live in the world we do with humans as they are Israel's hands were pretty tied. They had to respond, even if grand scheme of things it leads to more death.

Comment,">I'd be happy to buy you a first class ticket to Gaza so you can find out more about the Palestinian people.

Israel controls and have controlled all entrances to Gaza, making them effectively an open-air prison, aka unaccesible to outsiders. 
Also, unlike **you**, not 30 years ago, my country and people went through a situation comparable to what's ongoing in Gaza. 

However, if you're really eager to throw money around, there's a lot of charity groups dedicated to helping the poor civilians Israel decided to genocide.

Comment,"Reuters is citing the health ministry
“Gaza Strip where health officials said the number killed in a five-week-old Israeli bombardment had topped 11,000”

WHO is also working off the same numbers.

If you want to say you trust the health ministry’s numbers then sure that’s fine. However I don’t think anyone should pretend like they know for certain

Also the health ministry doesn’t separate by cause of death or whether the person dead was a combatant.

Hamas soldiers fake being medics, use ambulances for transport, and place their military operations inside hospitals. They've been doing this for decades now.

But Hamas soldiers sometimes wear medic uniforms while participating in the fighting. And Hamas soldiers sometimes use ambulances to transport their fighters and weapons. And Hamas soldiers use hospitals as their bases of operations.

This is terrible because now the IDF can't tell who is a legitimate medic and which is a legitimate ambulance. It can't tell who in a hospital might be a doctor and who might be a soldier.

Comment,"I have no doubt Israel can defeat Hamas *in the short term*, my fear is that they are gonna end up with their own Afghanistan, where they win the war but lose the peace. This is why they need to make sure they kill as few Palestinian civilians as possible, the less collateral damage, the less angry friends and family driven to replenish Hamas' ranks.

I recall a few days ago Israel also stated they don't plan on being in control of Gaza for long, which worries me because if they just peace out after most of the Hamas militants are dead, there isn't really anything stopping them from rebuilding. Hamas was able to build massive tunnel systems and weapons factories in Gaza, and they'll be able to do it again unless the IDF essentially occupies Gaza until hopefully more moderate Palestinian forces appear that are able to keep Hamas and other extremist groups down with minimal Israeli support. Hoping for more moderate Palestinians to emerge is a pretty big ask though, Hamas has been in power for a long time and has likely killed anyone in Gaza who openly advocated peace with Israel by now, the often heavy hand the IDF exercises on Palestinians when looking for militants, and the issue with Israeli settlers in the West Bank also don't help foster peaceful or moderate sentiments.",2023-11-11T07:27:38,LargeMobOfMurderers,0,Comment,https://www.business-standard.com/world-news/idf-gains-control-of-hamas-territory-in-northern-gaza-kills-150-terrorists-123111100052_1.html

Comment,"Okay well death toll is a meaningless number without knowing how many were combatants (or how they died). The majority of people don’t think that Israel would be wrong if they killed 100,000 Hamas “fighters”. People care about civilian losses.

Comment,"AFAIK they are the only official body that provides estimates.   
All other international bodies do is provide their assessment on the accuracy. I'm not aware of a dispute regarding the overall number ATM. 

~~Your~~ The first link shared above cites the Gaza ministry as the source:  
""Palestinian officials said on Friday 11,078 Gaza residents had been killed in air and artillery strikes since Oct. 7.""
 
The second link is without citation of sources, so I assume it's from the same source unless you can show otherwise.
  
  
As for the Hamas controlled part - originally there was a central health ministry. After Israel left the Gaza strip and Hamas were elected they placed it under the control of Hamas loyalists.
You can read more about it (with references) in Wikipedia:

Comment,"“According to Jewish law, a Jew is to be buried as he was born - complete with all his limbs and organs. The human body is considered as sacred in death as it was in life as it contained a G‑dly soul. He must be buried in a traditional grave in the ground, so that the body may return to the earth.

Burial in vaults, above-ground mausoleums, crypts, and any other alternatives to a traditional ground burial are strictly forbidden according to Jewish law.

Kabbalah teaches that when a proper kosher burial is not administered, the deceased's soul is stuck in a state of turmoil and cannot find rest until the body's remains are given a proper Jewish burial and allowed to be absorbed into the earth - even after many years!”

Comment,"The UN has documented and denounced various forms of human rights violations against Palestinians by Israeli authorities, including arbitrary arrests and torture. As of April 10, 2022, there were **4,450** Palestinians held in Israeli jails in Israel and the occupied territory¹. Of those:

- **530** are held without charge or trial under the administrative detention policy, which allows Israel to detain Palestinians for renewable periods of up to six months without presenting any evidence or charges against them. This is the highest number of administrative detainees since 2016.
- **160** are children, who are often subjected to physical beatings, strip searches, blindfolding, and ill-treatment during detention and interrogation¹. Israel is the only country in the world that tries children in military courts, often denying them their basic rights¹.
- **32** are women, who face gender-based violence, harassment, and discrimination in Israeli prisons¹.
- **549** are serving life sentences, and **499** are serving a sentence of more than 20 years.

Over the course of 2021, the Israeli military arrested nearly **8,000** Palestinians, including more than **1,300** minors and **184** women, according to prisoners’ rights group Addameer. The month of May saw the highest number of arrests, with **3,100** Palestinians taken into Israeli custody  .

One of the most prominent cases of arbitrary arrest and torture by Israeli forces was the death of activist and critic Nizar Banat, who was beaten to death by Israeli soldiers in June 2021. Banat was a vocal opponent of the Israeli occupation and the Palestinian Authority's cooperation with Israel. Despite the public outcry and the international condemnation, no one has been held to account for his death, and Israel has continued to arrest and repress peaceful protesters and dissenters. The UN has urged Israel to conduct a transparent and independent investigation into Banat's death, and to bring those responsible to justice

Comment,"Unfortunately, as recent as yesterday where the death toll was lowered from 1400 to 1200 and the IDF revealed that shooting happened indiscriminately from their army from above as it was difficult to distinguish their own citizens from Hamas members. The burns of some victims are consistent with attacks by IDF weaponry, which was further supported by Nova attendees that stated they were being shot at by their own army. 1200 is still fucking horrible, I’m just point out the most recent discrepancy. 

Additionally, a spokesperson for Netanyahu posted a bts video shot in Lebanon as “evidence” that Palestinians were faking their injuries and death. Another moment of incorrect, official reporting. 

They lied about the journalist, Shireen’s assassination only taking claim months later. They lied about their involvement in Omar Assad’s death, an elderly man who suffered a heart attack after poor treatment by the IDF. They lied about their involvement in American activist Rachel Corrie’s death, even though there countless witnesses saw her being run over by an IDF bulldozer. They released false audio of Hamas fighters discussing the bombing of a hospital, where it was debunked due to the accents and other details. They claimed they would never bomb hospitals, and have now bombed 5.

A quick sumary:

1. A Gazan ""medic"" in a distinguishing orange vest runs up to a downed Hamas soldier during a firefight.

1. The ""medic"" ignored the wounded soldier and grabs the rifle

1. The ""medic"" ferries the rifle to another Hamas fighter.

1. The other Hamas fighter uses the rifle

1. Bonus: The wounded Hamas soldier, after his rifle is taken, gets counted as a civilian casualty.

Comment,">Precision strikes don't kill 10,000+ innocent civilians.

Yes... they do. If you had 10,000 precision strikes that killed 10,000 terrorists (one strike for each) then you'd have 10,000 people dead from precision strikes. You're wrong to say that that no longer counts as precision strikes because the death count reached a certain number.

Take into account how many bombs were dropped, 25,000 tons of explosives. That same amount in an actual indiscriminate bombing, in a very densely populated area like Gaza, would result in over 100,000 dead.

Comment,"> lowered from 1400 to 1200 

From what I understand, the initial estimations incorrectly included the bodies of some of the terrorists, dressed as civilians of course, that were assumed to be Israeli citizens. The fact that Israel corrected the number of its own accord, and not through some ""leak"", is noteworthy on its own.

I'm not familiar with all the examples you gave, but let's assume they are true. It's unfortunate but believable that Israel sometimes tries to cover up things that make it look bad. Every country in the world does this. But this is a different matter.

The stories of burned and beheaded babies sent a shock through the entire Israeli population. This is not a lie that can be made lightly. If anyone was caught to have lied about this, they would face very severe consequences. And there are videos of ordinary medics describing it while in tears, pictures of burned babies that someone would have to knowingly fabricate.

It looks like building a miliary base with large weapons caches under a hospital. The using that as a launch site to launch thousands of rockets to homes and civilian and medical infrastructure in Israel. Everyone knows the base is there and being used for terror attacks. The UN knows the base is there and being used for terror attacks. They say nothing and do nothing.

Then when Israel go ""ok this military base has to be stopped, enough of our people have died"" having your useful idiots in the west go ""OMG did you see Israel literally target that hospital and genocide like a billion babies? Hamas did like nothing wrong.""

Not one of the several hundred thousand people who have been killed in American wars. Not the years and years of occupation after said wars. Being an ally to Israel. THAT is what caused 9/11.

Comment,"> Getting to the point where a human is even capable of committing them requires

Bollocks. 

Most of the members of Al Qaeda, for example, who died in the 9/11 attacks were from rich, privileged Saudi families. Most of them had never even fought in any war or ever even faced hardship, let alone violence. Their mission statement was to overthrow the Saudi king and they chose the US because they put boots on the ground in the KSA to defend them from an imminent invasion from Saddam Hussein (after he had just invaded Kuwait).

None of that has anything to do with ""dehumanization and weaponized anger and/or desperation"".

In fact, most terrorists are just bored middle- or upper-class psychopathic assholes.

>Asked at Wednesday’s House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing about skepticism over the numbers released by the Gaza Health Ministry, Barbara Leaf warned that the numbers may fall short. “We think they’re very high, frankly, and it could be that they’re even higher than are being cited,” said the Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs. She added that in times of war it is difficult to get an accurate assessment. “We’ll know only after the guns fall silent.”

>Leaf acknowledged that Hamas is particularly skilled at spreading propaganda and disinformation via social media, but said that based on the feedback they are receiving from a variety of individuals and partners on the ground, “it’s very possible that they’re even higher than is being reported.” Gaza health authorities say more than 10,800 people have been killed there, most of them women and children.

Comment,"As someone who has lived in Punjab state for 4 years.
Sikhs are one of the nicest people and friends I made. 

But the sad thing is there is extremism too, which can't be denied, you might not even heard of Air India Flight 182.
And even recently Gurpatwant Singh panun, issued multiple threat to do similar thing to Flight 182, and other threats as well including threats to Canadian Hindus and he is living comfortably in Canada. Just go to YouTube, just watch 2,3 videos of him, see how much hate he spew.

Not everything in as black and white as it seems.

Example, many people have this image of Genghis Khan as a great leader, now imagine being one of the few who survived, from the millions he killed in china. Would they call him leader or murderer???

Extremism starts from somewhere, and where it leads, we all have seen by now. And it truly exists in each and every religion. Can give you example for each one.

US to Press India on Countering China More in Asian Waterways,,2023-11-11T02:50:12,Blank_eye00,81,5,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-09/us-to-press-india-on-countering-china-more-in-asian-waterways
Comment,">The US is likely to push India this week to take a more prominent role in deterring China in the region, a move that risks deepening tensions between New Delhi and Beijing.

>The US wants India to share some of its burden in the Indo-Pacific by increasing its diplomatic and military presence in the region, Indian officials aware of the details said, asking not to be named since discussions are private.

>A bigger presence of the Indian Navy beyond Asian maritime choke-points and in to the tense South and East China Seas is also expected to be discussed, the people said.

>It would be wrong to “prejudge” the conversations between the officials, Arindam Bagchi, the spokesperson for India’s Ministry External Affairs, told reporters at a briefing Thursday. The US Embassy in New Delhi didn’t respond to an email seeking comment.


>The US request comes as it strengthens its alliances across Asia to deter what it sees as an increasingly assertive China, and tries to balance Beijing’s growing economic and military power. The US also faces the challenge of diplomatically and militarily supporting Ukraine and Israel in their respective battles against Russia and Hamas, which is considered a terrorist organization by the US and Europe.


>India has permanently deployed warships at five choke points in the Indian Ocean, stretching from the Gulf of Aden to the Lombok Strait in Indonesia. It has also sailed Indian naval vessels through the South China Sea in recent years.

>However, it remains unclear whether the Indian Navy can take on the additional burden of a more steady presence in the areas the US would want help in. Its warships are at sea for as many as 300 days a year undertaking routine patrols, as it attempts to remain the dominant force in the Indian Ocean amid China’s quickly rising naval prowess.

>India is in the process of buying 31 high-altitude endurance drones from the US that will substantially add to its ability to maintain a closer watch over the region.",2023-11-11T02:52:45,Blank_eye00,9,Comment,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-09/us-to-press-india-on-countering-china-more-in-asian-waterways

Comment,"So, here in Switzerland we had a vote on whether to make the necessary changes to the constitution to allow for this (it passed).

So I've read a bit into it there to make an informed decision, but it's been a while.

Basically, this isn't Germany taxing companies for earnings made worldwide. It's a deal between over a hundred countries to enforce a minimum tax globally.

The idea is, if I remember it correctly, that if a country does NOT honor the 15% minimum tax, then other countries like Germany that do honor it can demand the difference between that and the actual tax. So the company has to pay 15% regardless of whether the country plays along, part of those 15% might just go to different countries.",2023-11-11T08:55:50,Pamasich,63,Comment,https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/germany-approves-global-minimum-corporate-tax-2023-11-10/
Comment,"I don't know anything about how this particular mechanism works, but the fundamental mechanism is that countries are souvereign, and as such, they can make any laws whatsoever to apply within their borders.

As such, in principle, a country *can* make a law that specifies that any company on the planet has to pay taxes to them.

The difficult part then is enforcement of that law. If a company does not interact with the country in any way, they might be legally required to pay taxes in the country ... but nothing happens if they don't.

So, in practice, countries only tax entities that somehow economically interact with the country. The rules still in principle can be arbitrary--but of course, the above still applies, in that a country that demanded taxes that would make it uneconomical to operate in that country would just see companies leave, at best leaving behind any assets in the country that could then be liquidated by the country to pay outstanding tax debts.

So, in actual practice, countries usually don't tax global income, because that would usually cause international companies to just leave--but not because there is somehow a fundamental reason why they can't.

But of course one can create hybrid taxation rules where a country taxes global income in so far as it isn't taxed elsewhere, for example, to disincentivise tax avoidance via off-shoring.",2023-11-11T09:17:38,gSTrS8XRwqIV5AUh4hwI,11,Comment,https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/germany-approves-global-minimum-corporate-tax-2023-11-10/
Comment,"It's likely going to be done on corporations that *sell* in a country. So if a company opts to surrender that market and not participate, they'd be exempt. But if they or a distant subsidiary they've deeply tried to hide does sell to the market, then they'll be targeted.

Not participating means they get banned as they won't be in good standing.

It's an interesting approach. Another approach that was floated to counter these profit shifting schemes is to tax on revenue (e.g. you remove the expense deduction), but that has it's own downside (potential to overtax companies that aren't cheating and really need the capital).",2023-11-11T12:54:38,VegasKL,1,Comment,https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/germany-approves-global-minimum-corporate-tax-2023-11-10/

Comment,"Solution is surely just more VAT (sales tax).

You make <item> for £1, you sell for £1.50+tax so call it £2. At the moment, that means 50p profit before tax, and you pay some corporation tax on that, let's say 20% meaning 10p corp tax to make 40p final profit.

So:

The person buying it paid £2

50p of that was VAT. 

Government gets the 10p corp tax + the vat = a total of 60p.

Then, why not simply shift corporation tax over to VAT?

This way you make item for £1, you sell for £1.40 + vat, which would be £2 since VAT is now much higher.

Government still gets 60p. Customer pays the same. Corporation makes the same profit. Only now the corporation doesn't pay corporation tax. Which doesn't matter because the government gets its profit from the sale of the item.

The taxation comes from the person buying the item.

You might think that the corporation can then increase the price of the item, but they can't, the customer doesn't care what percentage of the final price is tax, it just cares about the total.",2023-11-11T19:04:52,NibblyPig,1,Comment,https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/germany-approves-global-minimum-corporate-tax-2023-11-10/

Comment,">They will lose a lot of high paying corporate jobs because then there will be no reason to incorporate in Ireland. 

Uh, what high paying corporate jobs? Those  ""corporate HQ's"" are glorified mailboxes. They maintain the minimum required there. The reason why the scheme (one of many) worked is because large companies would offload their IP to those holding companies and then license it back to various subsidiaries in other countries, allowing them to pay the invoices for the license to use that tech as an expense to bring down their taxable income elsewhere.


Simplified Example [pseudo numbers], the normal scheme involved a few more hops:

- Boogle Dublin owns all patent/IP for all tech.
- Boogle California uses that tech in their products they sell in California. Current taxable income, $100mil @ 25%.
- Boogle Dublin sends invoice for the license to use their tech in a product, $90mil (it's good tech, damnit!l.
- Boogle California happily pays this invoice. New current taxable income is now $10mil @ 25%. 
- Boogle Dublin pays their 1% income tax on $90mil.


Original Tax Bill: $25mil
New Tax Bill: $10mil + $1mil ($11mil)

You've saved: $14mil!

Comment,"agree on the money point (wealth hoarding is a disease on society) but not the first one.

more people has no relation to more homes. more homes is determined by demand (do people wanna move here?) and zoning laws (are we allowed to build more here? can we build high rises? are we restricted to single-family housing? etc.).

even if we assume ideal zoning laws are in effect (meaning mixed usage is ok, massive super-dense multi-family apartments are the only type of housing we build, etc), places will still fill up. we can only build so much in one area. NYC and London only have so much space. when cities are at maximum housing capacity, prices of housing will rise even if we have fair, logical, consumer protecting laws and 100% fair enforcement of them. it's simple supply and demand: when we hit max supply but demand keeps growing, price increases.

the issue is we *don't* have proper zoning laws *and* housing is being bought up as a speculative investment by the rich. this artificially restricts the supply of the housing market which is a huge reason we're seeing such an increase in price. demand is growing (population is getting bigger *and* more rich), but supply is limited, we can't build more, and available housing is *decreasing* because of the investments I mentioned earlier.

to restate: in desirable places with max housing capacity, we should expect to see an increase in price. max housing capacity is artificially limited in virtually all of these places. this means housing costs are rising faster than they should.",2023-11-11T10:04:31,kian_,1,Comment,https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/germany-approves-global-minimum-corporate-tax-2023-11-10/

Comment,"oh I know that pretty much every major company is located somewhere beneficial for tax purposes. it would be impossible (or at least unimagineably detrimental) to cut the people off from everything they produce/provide.

so obviously I don't mean enforce an embargo overnight, my idea is more like  EU + USA ratifying a minimum corporate tax (or any other measures) and then saying ""hey, either those tax haven countries need to align with our standard or you need to relocate to a country that does. you have 3/5/10 years to figure this out before the embargo goes into action.""

I don't think corporations would choose to lose all business while simultaneously causing a global collapse because no one can get the shit they need (whether that's food and medicine or construction and heavy industrial materials). I *hope* that's not the case, at least. of course I know this is an unrealistic utopia scenario because the US would never agree to something like this even if the EU does, but assuming they did, I don't really see how companies have a choice. Either play ball or intentionally burn down the world for another 5-10 years of egregious profit.

The point is the “richest wealth” doesn’t somehow cause unmanageable inflation or other nonsense said earlier and their wealth while huge relative to other individuals is still small relative to the US ANNUAL budget and GDP.  Redistributing their entire wealth is a one time affair that wouldn’t actually fix anything.

With more countries adopting the new deal and raising their own rates, it increases the foreign tax credits that US companies can take, so that they can offset even more of their US liability

Comment,"Empty postering.

This is a show meant for the conservative base of Erdogan. They've voted for him and all in all they got nothing return really and Erdogan can't give them anything really. So he's  throwing them a meaningless bone by screeching against Israel and they eat it up. It's meant to cover for the disasterous economical situation in Turkey. 

I am not even remotely worried. He knows exactly about the importance of Israel for Turkey, especially in terms of military cooperation. He knows that the US would end him in a day when he attempts anything stupid. 

Small reminder that this guy won the elections by just 52 percent eventhough he did all the manipulation and other irregularities and even emptied the treasury. Turkey is extremely divided and that guy isn't popular and he reigns via intimidation and repression. He doesn't has the political power to pull of anything more than screeching in front of brain dead supporters. People would literally storm his palace if he would suggest Turkish soldiers to die for Arabs (*there's already an extemely tense situation regarding to immigration and refugees from MENA countrie*s. *Turkish society is on a boiling point at this and lots of problems*).",2023-11-11T08:04:46,Weltraumbaer,11,Comment,https://sot.com.al/english/bota/sulmet-ne-gaza-erdogan-kercenon-izraelin-po-teston-durimin-tone-i623160

Comment,"Why are so many people cool with Israel’s colonialism of Palestinian lands? 1/2 of Israel’s claimed territory was conquered unilaterally; Israel beats down and subjugates Palestinians for decades while distracting the world with facile and insincere rhetoric about a 2 state solution, and when tensions boil over and they resist they use it as a pretext to bomb the shit out of them or take more territory. The Israeli government is a right-wing Islamophobic government who have committed a [laundry list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_war_crimes) human rights abuses against innocent Palestinians over the years.  Have murdered over 10 000 people in the last month,  a third of them children.  Now the war criminal Netanyahu has denied an international peacekeeping force in Gaza and states the IDF will stay indefinitely -  this is a genocide and Jews of all people should know better.  **A note! None of this excuses Hamas’ brutal and inhumane attacks on innocent Jews last month; but using it as a pretext to slaughter innocent Palestinians and further absorb more territory is equally evil and no pathway to peace.

Comment,"No sympathy for Erdogan but the article just cherry picked some words, and within 160+ commentors most didn't even read the article, comments are just over the title.

I would rather him to stop saying things from his high-gear which are so easy to twist. But cannot teach old dog new tricks, plus can't get rid of it appearently... 

But he doesn't say anything about military intervention or so. His statement comes down to ""we will support any *political* step taken against the oppression of civilians and we are glad international community (of people) started to raise their voices over this"".

This twisting, cherry picking and mistranslation is really annoying. So annoying that makes me wanna clarify the statements of the guy who oppresses me *personally*. 

Because I read it here first, I say NO HE DIDN'T, then I find the full speech, and notice how misleading the article was. 

Here is a full translation via Google translate. 

> They are testing our patience with threats to use nuclear weapons, with the delusion of a promised land that includes our country's territory. The days are near when those who cannot cope with the innocent children, women and elderly of Palestine, despite their technological superiority and immoral tyranny, will wake up from this crude dream.

> Of course, they should be held accountable for the lost lives of tens of thousands of civilian people, from unborn babies to innocent children, to oppressed women and men. Of course, there will be accountability for the oppression that millions of people have been subjected to for the sake of sick fanaticism for almost a century. Each of these oppressors (means any side, not just Israel) and those who are complicit in the same crime through their support will be judged first in the conscience of humanity and then in front of history.

> As Türkiye, we will pioneer this work on all platforms. A significant part of the states and administrations in the world may be turning a blind eye to the oppression taking place. But the voices rising from the consciences of the people of these countries are increasing day by day, which gives us hope for the future of humanity. 

> With the strength we receive from the voice of collective conscience, we will fully support the will of the people of Gaza not to leave their homes and lands. We will not stop speaking the truth and correcting the wrong until the security of life and property of all Palestinian people, especially the Gazans who are struggling to protect their homeland, lives and honor, is ensured.

Note: 
In his previous speech he said he has no problems with people of Israel or country of Israel. 

But he has problems with some parts of Israel government acting like a gang after a religious idea. Which in return creates and funds gangs opposing to it, like Hamas. 

If gang within Israel counts itself as government, gang against this oppression won't count itself as terrorists but freedom fighters. 

Well last line of this speech was taken and converted to clickbait worthy headlines, ""Erdogan says Hamas is not terrorist organization"". 

He could've say ""hatred breeds hatred"" and not write a poem about it but nope, gotta cause international trouble for Turkey every time he opens his mouth, cannot do otherwise.

For example at first, he was giving speeches that gave condolences to people of Israel, a calm and thoughtful processes of cleaning of Hamas and being careful about civilians. Didn't make headlines even in Turkey. Then he being such a diva, raised the level multiple times until he is clickbait worthy again.",2023-11-11T10:41:58,B3H4VE,1,Comment,https://sot.com.al/english/bota/sulmet-ne-gaza-erdogan-kercenon-izraelin-po-teston-durimin-tone-i623160

Comment,"its EU membership is pretty much completely Frozen near the start of the process. It hasn't really progressed for a long time, and will not at the very least until someone replace Erdogan and roll back lots of things he did in his country.

NATO membership is another story unfortunately. IF they didn't own the passageway to the black sea and for ex. Greece was owning it instead, this could happen, but they're in a strategic position in way too many ways and Erdogan has basically been playing on this to do whatever he wants without getting kicked out.

&#x200B;

Unless Erdogan starts war against a NATO member which leads to Turkey losing key territory in the process, it's very unlikely that they'll ever get more than sanctions from the other members. And even if Erdogan is an idiot, he isn't THAT foolish. When they had a spat with Greece over their respective EEZ, Erdogan made sure to never cross the line that would have made France go at war with them. He played the tough guy to not lose face but ended up cancelling what he was doing nonetheless. He was certainly playing with fire, but didn't make a mistake on the moment to pull out of the situation.

Comment,">Russia is not a joke. It’s been 2 years entire west has been throwing resources, ammunition, rockets, tanks to Ukraine and Russians are still fighting on.

You're so wrong here. Two major points:

1. West has been throwing leftovers, just enough for Ukraine to not collapse on the spot, but never enough to outmatch russia in anything - amount of shells fired, amount of tanks, artillery, APCs, drones, ammo - everything is either on par or less than russia has.

2. This is a major one - no West country has ever nor will ever supply soldiers. This is most important point because at the end of the day it's people who drive APCs, defend/capture positions and look for targets to shoot etc. And Ukraine does not have unlimited personnel.

We're not even talking about stuff like NATO denying Ukraine to use their weapons on russian territory on military targets which is totally legit way of self-defence and many other points.

Your take ""russia is strong because it can fight Ukraine for 2 years and not collapse"" is laughable.

Comment,"Just going by your scenario let's say turkey sides with Russia after kicked out of nato,  Turkey's economy is already weak considering that , how will their economy and military industry complex perform when it's blasted with sanctions for supporting russia 
Even for the sake of this argument lets consider turkey as a strong economic power house, even then western sanctions would cripple turkey in a very bad way

Comment,"Turkey is only useful because of it's access to the black sea. Turkey is only a regional power. They rant and rave but if push came to shove the US/NATO would tear them a new one. Turkey can only act the way they do because they are in NATO. If they where out of NATO and hostilities broke out they'd lose Cyprus and the EU and US would back Greece's territorial claims. Their army has a respectable core but is mostly conscripts in your theoretical million man army. They have a ok Air Force but it's mostly older Fighter Jets and only around 200. Their Air Defense is a absolute joke even with a few S-400's. The US would destroy a Turkish economy with sanctions without ever having to send in troops. 

If Turkey got hostile towards Israel as per what this post is implying it's a empty threat. Turkey on land couldn't reach Israel and even if they did Israel's Air Force would eat them alive. I'd put any Israeli fighter jet and Pilot over any Turkish Fighter Jet. Turkey does have a ok navy but again Israel's Air Force would keep them at a distance otherwise they'll get sunk.

Comment,"Turkey has been sanctioned before when their economy was worse, due to events of 1974, they came out just fine. Not only that, sanctions made them realize they can’t rely on foreign military tech alone, which was the spark the triggered the rise of military complex of today. 

Not only that, sanctions hurt those who impose them as well the target country, trade suffers, agriculture suffers, everything gets affected.

Look at the state of the world now with all the sanctions against Russia, war and turmoil.

And Erdoğan is not even the most eccentric character to lead Turkey since they joined NATO long time ago.

Comment,"Not really.

Turkey joined NATO as they were at the brink of war with USSR because of Stalin’s paranoia post WW2.

Turkey is no friend to Russia and they value NATO, NATO also values them. 

Politics aside NATO armies and Turkish army work very well together. 

I have been in Turkey and saw this myself.

Turkish Special Forces have been trained by American Green Berets and Navy Seals for years and lot of them maintain a friendship long after their work together. 

USA maintains an important military base in Turkey and during Cold War Turkey housed nuclear weapons for NATO as deterrent towards Soviets.

Turkish control in Black Sea, Mediterranean and Aegean Sea also offer safe passage to NATO and strategic advantage over the area.

Turkey also passes valuable intel to NATO about ongoing conflicts in the area. 

As for USA/NATO “tearing Turkey a new one”.

This is where west was often wrong and vastly underestimated Turkish people.

Turks have been in Anatolia for 1000 years.

There are not many people on earth this resilient and stubborn to hold on to a land this long.

You are talking about a culture whose collective support for each other withstood Mongol invasions, Crusades, WW1, Gallipoli and won war of independence against the strongest nations on earth under Ataturk.

And I think you are overestimating USA, American military might may be effective against a bunch of disorganized Iraqis with varying loyalties and Afghan tribesman -which US failed to subdue anyway- I’ll remind you that the greatest invasion force world has ever seen up until Gallipoli could barely advance few miles inland from the shore.

Erdoğan may be a loudmouth but do not underestimate Turkish soldier.

We saw from Ukraine what a determined infantry is capable of against a ruthless and uncompromising enemy when defending their homeland.

Turkish society love their army and any conflict involving the army will have full support of people.

I don’t think same could be said for USA.

Despite all of this, Ukraine was holding itself incredibly well against the full might of the Russian army. NOBODY expected this. Everyone was hugely overestimating the Russian capabilities. They played big (taking Kyiv in 3 days) and failed miserably.

Also, we have no credible figures of the J-20’s RCS.

Anyone who does have the information in intelligence circles isn’t sharing it either. The J-20 having shit RCS is speculation and honestly nearly unfounded. The narrative was that “canards are shit for stealth” until multiple people from the industry disproved this claim and then the narrative was that the J-20 had shitty RAM coatings (not sure how anyone would even be able to prove this considering the J-20 “hasn’t seen active combat”) and so on.",2023-11-11T14:36:39,Rexpelliarmus,-1,Comment,https://sot.com.al/english/bota/sulmet-ne-gaza-erdogan-kercenon-izraelin-po-teston-durimin-tone-i623160

Comment,"The palestinian authority doesn't have the means to govern an area as large as gaza. It would be difficult for israel to do, but they're more qualified for the task. If they don't want the job. Security work is work that can be given to people in the face of automation. Then UN peacekeepers can take over the area, but it should not be given to the palestinian authority. They'll take money from arab countries to rebuild it. 

With that money will come a price. Nothing is free. The countries that give the palestinian authority money to rebuild and govern gaza will have them build more weapons, install new puppet leaders for arab countries to threaten israel with. Israel can agree to the palestinian authority taking it over, but it'd be against your self interest. You should take your security matters into your own hands. Not leave it to chance.

The most common work in an age of expanding technology will be and can be security work. Increasing global stability and global peace. Expanding the UN into a peace keeping organization. Recruiting volunteers to peace keep in areas around the world that lack peace. I strongly disagree with Ron Desaintis that the UN is a worthless institution.

The guy who was hit wouldn't have lost a leg. He would have been turned into fine mist by said missile alone, nevermind the blades. 

A Hellfire missile is 1.8 meters long, weighs around 40kg, and can reach speeds of over 1000km/h. The kinetic energy of one of those would turn a person into something you could drink through a straw. 

This sounds more like a drone of some kind, or a dud artillery shell, or something. Whatever it is, it is too small, and too slow, and caused way too little damage and debris to be a Hellfire R9X.

Ambulance convoy, bombed just outside the hospital gate.

Palestinian Red Crescent was at the scene, and confirmed all casualties were civilian, and the area was very crowded at the time of the strike. Whether or not you trust Red Crescent, I leave up to you.

The hospital also confirmed all victims were on the list of authorized evacuees, on their way to Rafah Crossing and Egypt. Whether or not you believe the hospitals director, I also leave up to you.

Israel has so far provided no evidence that would allude to this strike being lawful. Only unsubstantial claims, which have been contradicted by both journalists who documented the event, and OSINT.

Sorry chum. Your little attempt to launder Hamas reputation and distract from what they do to Palestinians (never mind Israelis) isn’t going to work. 

That hospital isn’t a hospital, no matter the fact that it has a Neo natal unit. It really brings a tear to my eye, watching Hamas apologists who defend a mob that uses Palestinian kids as meat shields cry “will someone think of the children”. You’re really plucking them heart strings. 

It’s a command complex that’s about to stop being a command complex. If you don’t like what that’ll do to the neonatal unit, maybe come here and level some criticism against the people who wrapped themselves in a civilian hospital cloak, punched Israel in the face and then turned their back and the hospital draped on it towards Israel.

Kertzer told the New York Times that he was “flabbergasted” to discover a German Nazi prince who acted as a go-between with Hitler and the Pope and that a top Vatican advisor wrote a letter to the Pope urging him not to protest an order to roundup Italy’s Jews and send them to concentration camps”

“The Catholic Church worked to win clemency for convicted Nazi war criminals after the war. “The justification given for aid to Nazi war criminals was Christian love and mercy,” says Brown-Fleming, whose research focuses on this effort. “I’m finding that the Holy See wanted to show gratitude for the protection of the city of Rome during the occupation of Rome under the Nazis in 1943”

Comment,"Day 615-626 of my updates from Kharkiv.

It has been somewhat quiet here since my last post, we had one Shahed attack at the start of the month that damaged some civilian infrastructure, and then we had another couple of drone attacks that were repelled, one of them happened just yesterday with drones flying over the city and being intercepted. There were no missile strikes aimed at our city during that time, but some missiles still did fly through our region on their way to other cities.

During their one “successful” drone attack they managed to damage a college, a couple of garages, about 4 civilian cars and some other administrative building. As usual there were no military targets anywhere nearby, they are just addicted to attacking any educational facility that they can manage to find on a map. Thankfully their other drone attacks didn’t manage to destroy anything in the city, but they are still pretty annoying.

While it is “relatively” quiet here in the city, with some occasional drone strikes that we are already used to, in Kharkiv oblast it’s not quiet at all. Villages/towns only about 15km away from us are still being shelled every single day, they are also being hit by glide bombs almost every day. Not including the air raid alerts caused by the MiG-31K, most of the alerts we get in our region in the recent months are from some close-range bombers flinging Russian JDAM equivalents over the border to hit our civilian neighborhoods. 

We haven’t had any big missiles strikes in a really long time, but if they start doing them again this winter to hit our energy infrastructure, this time we will be ready to hit theirs back with our own drones, and I bet there will be a bunch of people from western countries and tankies from around the world saying that this is a war crime, and that only Russia is allowed to do it for whatever reason.",2023-11-11T15:35:28,SaberFlux,136,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/live/18hnzysb1elcs

>This field hospital is very modern and well-equipped. It has 32 beds, eight of which are intensive care beds, an operating room, computer tomography, laboratory, sterilization, and a medicine depot. 2/13

>There are also tents for administration, surgery preparation, waiting rooms and staff accommodation. There are also supply containers for sanitary facilities, transport, fresh and process water, medical gases and energy supply. 3/13

>The water networks are heated so that the pipes do not freeze in sub-zero temperatures. There is also a decontamination tent for chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear hazards and a triage room. 4/13
>
>Symbolizing Russian terror → The emblem with the Red Cross was intentionally not placed on the field hospital, as it would only serve as a target for the Russians.

>Now let's move on to the training. 10 Ukrainian soldiers were trained in detail for a total of 14 days. 5/13
>
>For reasons of limited space, the training of the Ukrainian soldiers took place at the Friedrichshafen exhibition centre during the summer break.
>
>Normally, training takes place on site at the deployment location, which was not possible this time for logical reasons. 6/13
>
>Some of the ten soldiers were deployed directly to the front and only received their orders for training in Germany shortly before their departure. 
>
>Accordingly, they had little to no opportunity to rest. This also led to slight concerns at Rheinmetall. 7/13
>
>One employee of Rheinmetall says: “Until they arrived, we didn't know what level of training and condition the Ukrainian team would be in.” 8/13
>
>However, his concerns proved to be unfounded. Half of the soldiers were already technically trained, the other half were already medically trained. Interpreters helped to overcome the language barriers. 9/13
>
>One employee of Rheinmetall says: “We were more than positively surprised — by the prior knowledge, but above all by the motivation”
>
>A statement that is heard again and again in connection with the training of Ukrainian soldiers. Not only in Germany. 10/13
>
>The Ukrainian soldiers were accommodated in hotels during their 14-day stay. The Ukrainian guests were also looked after intensively after work.

>The highest-ranking soldier in the Ukrainian delegation says: “We felt welcome from the very first moment.” 11/13
>
>He adds: “We have learned to really appreciate the German thoroughness and organization. Yes, we came from a different background. I had this unique experience and learned a lot. But that's precisely why I'm happy to go back to my home country.” 12/13
>
>He has only one thing to say about the mobile field hospital: “The variety of equipment is enormous. And as a doctor, I can say that everything here is very well-thought-out.”

Comment,"Under The Cover Of Drones And Helicopters, The Ukrainian Marine Corps Is Advancing—And Expanding Its Dnipro Bridgehead: Forbes

""Three weeks ago, the marines crossed the wide Dnipro River in southern Ukraine’s Kherson Oblast and secured a bridgehead in the settlement of Krynky on the Russian-dominated left bank.

The Krynky op actually began this summer, months before the first Ukrainian marines slipped across the Dnipro in small boats. As early as June, there were reports the Ukrainians were positioning powerful radio-jammers on the Dnipro’s left bank in order to create a 12-mile-deep zone where Russia’s explosive first-person-view drones cannot reliably operate, but Ukrainian drones can operate.

“Ukraine fielded a number of powerful river-mobile drone-jammers while at the same time deploying slightly larger FPV drones with different radio operating frequencies that the jammers don't cover,” noted Trent Telenko, a former quality auditor with the U.S. Defense Contract Management Agency who specializes in electronic warfare.

At the same time, Ukraine’s own drones and manned warplanes began hunting down Russian jammers in southern Ukraine, effectively preventing the Russians from preventing Ukrainian drones from flying over the Dnipro. Evidence abounds of Ukrainian precision strikes on Russian jammers—even mobile jammers fitted to trucks.

The Ukrainian army and air-assault forces’ costly summer advances through Robotyne toward Tokmak, in Zaporizhzhia Oblast just east of Kherson, brought Russian logistics well within range of the Ukrainians’ longer-range weaponry.

“This logistics corridor becomes increasingly narrow for every inch the Ukrainians liberate,” explained Jan Kallberg, a non-resident senior fellow with the Center for European Policy Analysis in Washington, D.C.

“As winter approaches, the logistic situation west of Melitopol is likely to get worse and worse,” Kallberg predicted. But it apparently already is bad enough that the Kremlin is struggling to feed and fuel its forces on the Dnipro’s left bank.

Cross-river ops are extremely vulnerable to air-attack, but it quickly became clear the Ukrainians, not the Russians, control the air over the Dnipro in Kherson Oblast. The Ukrainian army even has deployed Mil Mi-24 attack helicopters for extremely low-level rocket attacks. One Russian observer called the Mi-24 raids “daring tactics.”

As the Ukrainian counteroffensive in Kherson enters its second month, it’s only expanding and accelerating. This week, Russian sources reported Ukrainian marines crossing the river at two new locations west of Krynky: Poima and Pidstepne.

Winter is coming. And, with it, the winter mud. The apocalyptic mechanized battles raging in eastern Ukraine—around Bakhmut, Kreminna and Avdiivka—could ebb as vehicles get mired.

But the marines in Krynky might not mind the mud so much. Advancing mostly on foot, in assault teams of 10 to 15 people, they could sustain the counteroffensive even as the weather worsens.

Comment,"Mitch McConnell, standing apart in a changing GOP, digs in on his decades-long push against Russia - Associated Press

""From his perch as the long-time Republican leader in the U.S. Senate, McConnell has emerged as perhaps the strongest advocate in Congress for sending billions of dollars in American assistance to Ukraine as the country fights Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion, aligning himself with President Joe Biden and majority Democrats in the process.

As he faces the end of his fourth decade in the Senate, McConnell’s unwavering advocacy for Ukraine has set him apart from many of his GOP colleagues, many of whom are deeply skeptical or outright opposed to U.S. involvement abroad — particularly in Ukraine. It’s an increasingly prevalent view in the Republican Party, shaped under the influence of former President Donald Trump, who has railed against “forever wars” and praised Putin.

“Honestly, I think Ronald Reagan would turn over in his grave if he saw we were not going to help Ukraine,” McConnell said in an interview with The Associated Press this week. He called the Ukraine aid, which Biden has asked Congress to pass as part of a $105 billion request for Israel and other countries, a “no brainer.”

- To get to the evacuation point, where first line medics are, they are often **transported by brothers on foot**.^1  Sometimes armored vehicles can pick up, but since those are targeted, it’s difficult. Depending on fighting..
- Many, many medics have been killed.
- Day of interview, a soldier who stepped on petal-mine and had an injured ankle was manually **carried** 4km [2.5mi] **by 6 men** to the evacuation point.^2
- They get radio calls from the soldiers’ command so know when incoming. Also get vague info about movements, so are prepared ahead of time.

^^1  ^(Some directions have coordination between the sides to allow for retrieval of wounded and dead.

There’s places where this definitely does not happen—the meat assaults.)


^^2 ^(I’ve read elsewhere: How many men required to carry wounded to evacuation point fluctuates—factors include if [1] still under fire why evacuating, and [2] physical issues—meaning [a] severity of wound/stability of wounded, [b] whether will have to physically run to get him  to medic, [c] distance.  Sometimes, it’s just one other that accompanies. However, it can also take as many as 8 men to physically carry someone out—alternately groups of four who are running a long distance—note that that would mean that certain injuries to one soldier **could take 9 men out of a fight for several hours**.)",2023-11-11T01:46:12,Nvnv_man,35,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/live/18hnzysb1elcs

While the clock has been ticking, recent losses have been considerable. Maintaining a consistent level of personnel is going to become increasing difficult as the pool of potential candidates becomes smaller.

Comment,"Elon’s view (see Lex Friedman interview https://youtu.be/JN3KPFbWCy8?si=AMk9QUOKdtfD7Cg_) is that the military situation (minefields, established defensive positions, lack of air superiority for either side) means that whoever attacks will lose huge numbers of troops, so both are stuck in a stalemate like WW I.

In that situation he is suggesting there is no point in continuing … neither party can win, so the continuing losses would be pointless.

Rightly or wrongly, in such a scenario he would argue they may as well agree to stop fighting, effectively freezing the current borders.

Not supporting this (my view is that the aggression need’s consequences or else we will see more, and that the west should do whatever is necessary to support a Ukrainian victory, which it won’t do if it believe the situation is a stalemate) but just thought it was worth understanding (my understanding of) his reasoning.

If you don’t like Elon’s outcome, maybe the key is for the west to ensure Ukraine does have a path to victory.

Comment,"> Russia has currently deployed over 400,000 soldiers in Ukrainian territory, Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR) spokesperson Andrii Yusov said during a KYIV24 television broadcast on Oct. 23.

[Kyiv Independent](https://kyivindependent.com/military-intelligence-400-000-russian-soldiers-occupy-ukrainian-lands/#:~:text=Military%20intelligence%3A%20400%2C000%20Russian%20soldiers%20occupy%20Ukrainian%20lands,-Share&text=Russia%20has%20currently%20deployed%20over,KYIV24%20television%20broadcast%20on%20Oct.)

I don't know about the accuracy but that's what Ukraine is claiming at least. But there are a few important caveats. Firstly not all those soldiers are combat troops at the front and a huge portion of them are there for things like logistics, or occupying land behind the line. The frontline is about 900km long and Russia controls a bit under 100,000 square kilometers of territory so even with that many troops Russia still has to spread their manpower relatively thin and the more troops they put at the front the more men are necessary to work on logistics as well.

This is a war of attrition but it's not about infantry fighting rifle to rifle in a giant meat grinder. The true war of attrition is about firepower specifically shells, rockets, mortars and FPV drones. You can give 1,000 guys rifles and order them to attack but if they get ripped apart by artillery 10km from the closest enemy then it didn't really matter. If Ukraine has the weapons they need they can inflict huge losses on Russia while sustaining very few of their own. 

Russia's overall strategy is to outlast the west and they believe if they can get through 2024 most western aid will dry up and they can thin overrun Ukraine or force an extremely one sided settlement. That is probably their best bet but simultaneously if Ukraine gets the weapons they need there's no reason to suggest that's inevitable.",2023-11-11T19:46:43,socialistrob,13,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/live/18hnzysb1elcs

I have no clue how the situation is around Avdiivka right now, but Rasputitsa is definitely a thing, and despite the popular myth of the harsh winter that broke the German Wehrmacht and Napoleons invasion of Russia, it really wasn't... It was Rasputitsa, spring and autumn, the harsh winter only is the cherry on the top, but even the Wehrmacht managed to gain back the initiative '41 once the ground was frozen after the offensive came to a complete halt in autumn, despite not being adequately equipped for winter.

It's funny how Putin not only made the same mistake with the initial invasion (spring) but also continues to repeat it.",2023-11-11T16:59:09,Even_Skin_2463,16,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/live/18hnzysb1elcs
Comment,"The 10 day forecast is for a lot of just above freezing temps daytime, just below freezing nights and increasing rain.  Depending on amounts, this should translate into mud, which can stall out effective vehicle support.  

Mobiks can likely continue to try to advance in most anything... but slowly on foot, in the rain, perhaps without adequate gear, bone-chilling wet cold, trying to assault fortified defenses, facing cluster munitions, without armor protection/firepower, possibly not even drone/air support if weather is bad enough.

Roads are subject to weight limitations and closures during the period in certain districts. The phenomenon was a notable hindrance in the early 20th century, since 40% of rural villages in the erstwhile Soviet Union were not served by paved roads.\[6\] The problem is less pronounced in elevated areas than in lowlands.

>Numerous restrictions on Palestinian trade in the West Bank gave Israelifirms a steep advantage over their Palestinian counterparts. The import and export restrictions intentionally constructed an imbalanced opportunity. For example, a military order levied a series of taxes on Palestinian manufacturers effectively making them pay 35-40% more taxes than their Israeli counterparts.32 In fact, from 1980 until 1997 such policies gave Israeli companies a defacto trade monopoly and accounted for just over 90% of all West Bank imports, which represents a shocking amount of protectionism.

Here is what it says about water use

Over-extraction of water resources in the West Bank has led to a decrease in the water table, which, in turn, has left many Palestinians (as many as 60% in area C) without running water, according to the World Bank and the UN.47 Intense control over water allocation is the most profound example of Israel’s intentions of economic colonizatio

Comment,"Funds, goods, services, and any other assistance. Aid comes in different forms not just money. But Israel has received US aid since its formation, which adjusted for inflation comes to something like $315 billion (from 1949-now), which is way more than any other country has received.

And as I’ve been trying to explain, being a developing country that recently achieved independence, in a global economy, makes it very difficult to grow without assistance. Many former colonies have poor infrastructure and low HDI, the common factor isn’t that they’re Arab it’s that they’re young nations. Maybe some
priorities may be different than western nations, but things like good healthcare and economic growth are definitely seen as good things in those countries.

I’m not saying you are wrong about the PEW poll obviously, I’m saying you’re incorrectly correlating what people feel about Sharia law in Palestine with the lack of development there.

Comment,"Tanks without combined arms are at high risk.
Tanks with active APS cannot have attached infantry.
Aps doesn't shoot drones.  It could be reconfigured to do so, but you would be destroying birds and your attached infantry.
APS can be detected, triangulated and used to shoot missiles.  Right now only mostly harm kind of missiles but..

So APS is quite problematic.

Comment,"Any armored vehicle that lacks support is vulnerable. This has been true since the first tanks rumbled across Europe in WW1. You need infantry especially for tank support. Fortunately, there are infantry-deployed anti-drone weapons. 

APS on every armored vehicle just isn't realistic at this point. For the time being, infantry and other support elements will do the protecting. 

India doesn't have much trouble providing infantry; they're the largest all-volunteer military in the world. What they need is armored support that can function at high altitudes.

Comment,"Indian media has made that claim, but Indian media is truly a special breed of stupid.

If India was worried the US would cut off supplies for their F-16s (which didn't compete against the Rafale, the final RFP was for twin engine aircraft...) or F/A-18s, why does the Tejas use a US engine (F404)? Why does the Tejas Mk2 use a US engine (F414)? Why does the domestic naval fighter use a US engine (F414)? Why does India's upcoming stealth fighter use a US engine (F414)? Why is their only anti-submarine fixed wing aircraft the US made P-8? Why does their Navy run on US made engines (LM2500)? 

Indian Air Force chose the Rafale because of a promise for domestic production that wasn't apparently true (which the Eurofighter didn't offer but US's bids did) and to punish the US for its support of Pakistan (per leaked diplomatic cables), and the Indian Navy chose the Rafale because the Indian Air Force already operated it.

Comment,"Before that point.

US was a huge supporter of India during the Sino-Indian War, but after that, the US tried to strengthen the relation with Pakistan with the thought ""if Pakistan and India are both US allies, they won't fight against 1 another"", which India took offense to and relations began to tank.

Then Nixon wanted to open relations with China again, and viewed Pakistan as the cornerstone to countering the USSR in Southeast Asia and the Middle East, which India took more offense to and in turn relied more on the USSR.

They would need someone on the ground to identify, and inspect the landing site. They would need a way to coordinate with Canadian citizens on the ground, and safely escort them to the aircraft. They would need nearby buildings secured to prevent a random HAMAS member from firing an rpg at the plane. If Canada has a partner like that in Gaza right now, they should ask that partner to rescue their citizens, because that is WAY easier.",2023-11-11T04:11:46,golyadkin,26,Comment,https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/no-canadians-approved-to-leave-gaza-on-friday-were-able-to-exit-global-affairs-1.6639235

Currently the areas bombed were claimed by IDF to be of importance to Hamas or that whoever is killed is a member of Hamas (and since they don't use uniform you'll never really know if it's true or not) but when the bombings become indefensable akin to one in 2014 where it was 3 boys at a beach, that's where you draw the line.

I'm just trying to quantify the amount of collateral damage it will take for you to change your mind. 

Israel has been reasonably precise in its attacks, and has made an attempt to avoid civilian casualties. In an urban setting against an enemy that uses human shields, a certain number of human collateral damage is unavoidable.

Given than Hamas's stated and proven goal is to rape and murder every Jew in Israel, that they have proven that they can succeed to some degree in that goal, and have stated that they will attempt to do so again, and that they have been launching rockets at civilians for 20 years, I would put the number of justifiable deaths at a much higher number than the <10,000 current number.

Comment,"That's a fair enough response. That makes a lot of sense at face value. 

There's two very good reasons why a military won't do that though. 

1. Your troops' lives are paramount. If you can not throw away the lives of 10,000 of your troops, and do it in a way that still follows the rules of war, you'll do that every single time.

2. There's no guarantee you don't lose just as many civilians this way. Just as many civilians die, and now you've got 10,000 troops dead too, all while you had complete air superiority. 

You and I might not like it, but Every. Single. Military. In. The. World would do the exact same thing. 

Now that all being said. Are you aware that IDF has been giving communication to Gazans for weeks to get clear of bomb sites? Phone calls. Leaflets. Radio. More phone calls.

Comment,"I would like to think if I had the real numbers that include knowing how many we should consider Hamas kills, how many were true militants killed and how many unwanted civilians killed by IDF, I hope that comparatively to whatever context is suitable we could be proud in the IDF doing above and beyond in the context

Still even if so, I am sad for any civilians killed 

Even more so I'm sad for any permanent injury and even for temporary ones

If the real numbers to a reasonable measure prove the IDF does abuse its strength I would condemn it and I would support organisations that try to restrain it due I do not believe this today and I am against them today.

So while I'm hopeful one way and have my vague belief I'm open to being disproved and changing my stance whether people believe me or not, I've changed my stance on topics while learning more, usually I try not to have a stance until I know more

Sometimes I don't know that I don't know, I thought I knew of a hard solution that would work and I changed my mind 

I'm working in tech and I need to keep learning all the time, can't argue that what worked 5 years ago is what we should do now 

The central point for this today is I don't believe there is any good source counting, if there was something like orxy for equipment in UA that could cover all the needed context I would (even they don't deal with personal kills as it's hard, due another tries to scope kills from cross referencing other data, but to get to the level I think is needed to take good judgement here seems really really hard)",2023-11-11T05:05:29,Comfortable-Sound944,8,Comment,https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/no-canadians-approved-to-leave-gaza-on-friday-were-able-to-exit-global-affairs-1.6639235
Comment,">Yes aware, but it's not their country to be telling civilians what to do,

Well honestly I wish Gaza was a country because that would mean there'd be a two state solution, but regardless, Israel declared war on Hamas. They invaded. The general niceties of jurisdiction don't apply when you declare war. 

During a war, it's at least nice to usher civilians to relative safety. Yes I know the south is still being struck, but it's about 20x safer in the south in terms of raw bomb drops. 

Hamas has been saying since day 1 for the citizens to ignore IDF safety warnings. I've got the screenshots from weeks ago to prove it. 

>Israel is one of the most advanced and funded military forces in the world, they can do better

America is THE most advanced military in the world. 500k civilians dead in Iraq. Technology doesn't stop scum bags from using civilians as human shields.

Now very different circumstances because in hind sight, America did not know that Iraq harbored the specific terrorists they were after. Israel knows exactly where Hamas went to: Gaza.",2023-11-11T06:15:18,BobbyBobbie,5,Comment,https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/no-canadians-approved-to-leave-gaza-on-friday-were-able-to-exit-global-affairs-1.6639235

Comment,"The source organisation releasing the information is of very low credibility to be, at minimum I think the numbers presented are 5x of reality, probably more today than at the start

People say >50% of people in Gaza are considered kids, Gaza is in the top 15% of birth rates for decades so that would connect the dots, also many conbatents are under age and they are the easiest to influence and they are thought this is the thing to aspire to in schools for a young age all throughout, and I can't get a video out of my mind of an adult with 6 or so young kids around a morters firing, for me if these kids die I'd count them as killed by Hamas, even if it's not the morters itself that blew them up, but counter fire by IDF

And no one counts Hamas kills by short fired morters and missiles or straight up executions for running away or not helping..

Among the videos there are fake ones, there are really bad fakes, there are semi fakes and sure some are real, and again I wish we could have 0 civilians hurt during the conflict

There are also reports of Hamas killing their own

IDK if there is any count and I don't necessarily buy the statement but Bibi said something about killing thousands of was it over a thousand of Hamas militants if and a big if that was true the numbers comparing to other military conflicts wouldn't be too bad for IDF trying to avoid civilians hurt 

Also again while I don't think it's nice for the civilians at all, but how many militaries have given weeks for civilians to leave the conflict zone, try to engage in that activity with their secret services and risk themselves and help their adversaries in favour of trying to save civilians

I do think there is a huge double standard asking from Israel/IDF to be 10 times better than any army has been in any conflict, and I don't just mean this round of the conflict 

I hate that number and I didn't look into it but suppose in most conflicts at least 80% are civilian kills, I wish somehow the IDF would get that to under 50% if we count only the truly innocent that weren't forced by Hamas to be there and didn't help Hamas in any way, but I don't really expect them to be better than any other army, I wish for it, but don't expect it, I wouldn't score them against an unrealistic metric, again I wish the numbers of uninvolved hurt by conflict could be 0.

I literally have the screenshots from their Telegram weeks ago demanding that people stay inside their homes even after receiving phone calls that their building will be bombed in 10 minutes.

Comment,"This is why gaza can't be given over to the palestinian authority's israel would be foolish to accept that. I'm saying israel needs to govern the region because it will fill up with terrorists and weapons again. Now's the opportunity to get in the middle of that. Stop it. Don't accept the international communities misguided pressure to give gaza to the palestinian authority. They'll allow another hamas government to form and we'll end up back in the same place.

and for the record just because the palestinian authority is palestinian it doesn't mean they'll treat their own people better. When you compare statement's from netanyahu who gets mischaracterized as a bigotted hateful person with the palestinians. The left sees all people the same, anyone that comes across as strong leader they assume is evil. Neglect the evils of weak leadership. How passivity on atrocities is allowing them to happen. You don't defeat evil with weakness, with platitudes, with appeasement, you beat it with strength.

Who do you think will be better able to manage an area, the wealthy nation of israel with a powerful military, or the poor territory of the west bank that doesn't have a strong military, that will accept money from iran to rebuild gaza. Efforts to destroy israel starting right back up again. Drone manufacturing facilities under new management. The palenstinian authority wouldn't stop it. In fact they'll encourage it.

Comment,"Geneva Convention also recognizes that civilians does not render military objectives immune to attack, but precautions needs to be taken.

Thereby proportionality comes in, that contrary to popular opinion is not the extent of a military escalation. (E.g. US bombing in Syria in retaliation).

[Excellent write-up explaining comprehensively yet simply - Proportionality](https://twitter.com/cptallenhistory/status/1723037202458857836)

I strongly recommend the above read to understand what Proportionality is in international law and how it's applied to military operations.

It's especially important given the rampant misconceptions that we're seeing even in the media.

Edit: I've to say this. Her explanation is factual. It's only at the last section where she gives an opinionated argument, where she attempts to debunk claims of disproportionate civilian casualties, but it's unrelated to proportionality.

I wonder why nobody protested against the US, Iraq and Iran (proxies) when they retook Iraqi cities back from ISIS.

I'm sure the civilian deaths were much, much larger than they are in Gaza, as I highly doubt that Iraq and Iran cared much about civilians.

Comment,"Bulk of the post is an explanation of what proportionality is and how it's applied in military operations, instead of an argument for the IDF. It's black and white factual.

Dry and technical Explanations of the same stuff from West Point [\[1\]](https://lieber.westpoint.edu/proportionality-international-humanitarian-law-principle-rule/) [\[2\]](https://lieber.westpoint.edu/contextualization-principle-proportionality-ihl-criteria-examples/)

It's only at the last section where she gives an opinionated argument about CCR, that's unrelated to proportionality and only relevance to those about if the IDF is indiscriminate. It's fine if you disagree with her. I'm skeptical of a low CCR, given the systematic embedding of military objectives not just within, but under civilian locations.

But it does not make the factual explanations untrustworthy. It's like disagreeing with subjective elements of a textbook and labelling the remainder as untrustworthy.

Nowhere in that Wikipedia article does it say that the 9:1 ratio is debunked misinformation. Rather it's widespread and controversial. What's debunked was the notion that the ratio flipped within a century. Doesn't make sense given technological advances reduced civilian casualties.

Comment,"My point is that ""ratio"" isn't necessarily raw counts. If instead you're measuring ""percentage of the population"", the global population of Jews (16 million) to Arab Muslims (~400 million), then 1200 dead Jews would be ""proportional"" to 30000 dead Arab Muslims. This would be the ratio Israel would need to achieve in an all-out, all-in war between them and the Arab world.

I'm not advocating for Israel killing 30000, but I am pointing out that proportionality as a concept isn't necessarily cleanly translatable to actual figures.

Comment,"You bring up the spectre of the holocaust with such pogroms as the 7th. You remind israel that the West other than the US would throw us to the wolves in a heartbeat to cozy up to the Arab world. You remind us of this when hamas is not condemned or fought by anyone else. You remind us that many arabs want to genocide us. And you remind us that those who most fervently wish it live a scarce 7 miles away.

Comment,"“Leaf acknowledged the ministry does not differentiate between civilians and Hamas combatants in its death toll — “they mingle them,” she said. But she underscored that the cost of Israel’s military operations on the besieged region, coupled with Hamas’s use of civilians as human shields, has been devastating. 

“In this period of conflict and conditions of war, it is very difficult for any of us to assess what the rate of casualties are,” she said during a Wednesday hearing of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. “We think they’re very high, frankly, and it could be that they’re even higher than are being cited.”",2023-11-11T03:23:58,tidder-la,17,Comment,https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/idf-troops-found-hamas-drone-manufacturing-plant-weapons-depot-in-gaza-residential-building/

Comment,"Well here's the question: is Israel currently taking an approach to defeating Hamas which will result in the fewest civilian casualties?

An example of an alternate approach with a reasonable chance at success and with fewer civilian casualties would prove that Israel is not.

Literally talked about this, and no, Hamas are not in control of the West Bank. The IDF is focused on Gaza. They're fighting Hamas. Please tell me how other groups only firing some rockets from far away, but not actually engaging the IDF somehow means the IDF is outnumbered when they're literally only focused on Hamas right now...

"Iceland evacuates the town of Grindavík due to imminent volcanic eruption, a response last seen 1973.",,2023-11-10T18:38:43,kARATT,2108,108,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/10/iceland-declares-state-of-emergency-over-volcanic-eruption-threat
Comment,"This marks an historical event closest to the evacuation of Vestmannaeyjar island in the 1973 eruption. 

Currently it cannot be excluded that it erupts within the town itself. 


Most notably this threatens the town of Grindavík housing 3.500 citizens, the blue lagoon and the sole power plant tasked with providing hot water and electricity to the 30.000 citizens on the Suðurnes peninsula. 

Data indicates that this is a considerably more powerful eruption that the previous two in the area. 

The significant activity in the Sundhnúkur craters could indicate that magma has reached shallow depths. 

The southern edge of the crater row is about 1 km from the nearest settlement of Grindavík and approximately 1500 meters from the Svartsengi power station. 

The Icelandic Meteorological Office notes a substantial change in seismic activity, moving south towards Grindavík. 

There is a likelihood that the volcanic activity has extended beneath Grindavík, according to the Icelandic Meteorological Office. 

The amount of magma involved is considerably larger than seen in the major eruptions associated with the Fagradalsfjall volcanic system.

Comment,"Until 2021, the last eruption of Fagradalsfjall was back in **1206**. It's erupted twice since, but both times just with simple lava flows that covered not even 1km^(2).

Not exactly dangerous lol. yearly eruptions like this are generally preferred because it's like slowly letting the pressure out of a cooker before it turns into a full on bomb.

And why even live there in the first place? Well, the dried magma flows bring up all kinds of invaluable minerals that make some of the best natural farming soil on the planet.

But I mean, I only lived on a volcano, so what do I know. Why do people live in Tornado Alley? Why to people live on fault lines? Why do people live in hurricane prone regions?

Comment,"This will be the fourth in a series of shield-like volcanoes on the peninsula.  Here's a nice video of the last one:

Except this one should be bigger (there's more uplift and *earthquakes), could come up underneath the power plant or the hot springs, if it does come up underneath water that can itself cause a big steam explosion (only at the start), and there's a town of 3k people ""downhill"" to the south.  Unlike the previous volcanoes this one  is on the ""other side"" of the ridge and should flow to the SW instead of the SE.  If it were just a bit further north then it could potentially flow NW and cut off the road from Reykjavik to the airport.

Historically this area has gone in periods of lengthy vulcanism, with the last one lasting from the 9th to 13th centuries ish and creating most of the top layer of the peninsula.

**Police investigating discovery in a General hospital clinical area**

The Ottawa Hospital says Ottawa police are investigating after someone found poured gasoline and what the hospital described as antisemitic messages at its General campus.

But police said later Friday that they aren't investigating a hate-motivated crime.

""Messaging left at the scene was not hate-related and spoke to the ongoing conflict in Gaza,"" a police spokesperson wrote in an email.

""Police will not provide further comments so as not to jeopardize the integrity of the ongoing investigation.""

In an email, a hospital spokesperson said they were found in a clinical area overnight on Thursday. Ottawa police said in an email officers were called around 11:15 p.m.

The area is being cleaned, the hospital said, and some appointments had to be rescheduled. Security measures have also been increased.

Hospital leadership ""condemns this deplorable act,"" according to the statement, which comes about a week after Ottawa's police chief condemned several recent hate-motivated crimes targeting Jewish and Muslim people.

After that, a 29-year-old man was arrested and charged with various hate-motivated offences. He allegedly made a threatening phone call to an Ottawa rabbi, who said hate toward Jewish people has ""skyrocketed"" after the Oct. 7 cross-border raid by Hamas that set off the latest Israel-Hamas war.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has called out what he describes as a ""terrifying"" rise in antisemitism and Islamophobia across the country.

The General campus hospital just had a major fire late last month that led to its emergency room being closed and forced the relocation of dozens of patients.",2023-11-10T18:29:54,MaleficentParfait863,32,Comment,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/ottawa-general-hospital-gasoline-antisemitism-1.7025224

Comment,"> The Ottawa Hospital says Ottawa police are investigating after someone found poured gasoline and what the hospital described as antisemitic messages at its General campus.

> But police said later Friday that they aren't investigating a hate-motivated crime.

> ""Messaging left at the scene was not hate-related and spoke to the ongoing conflict in Gaza,"" a police spokesperson wrote in an email.

It seems there was an attempted arson attack targeting a hospital. Antisemitic graffiti was found on the scene. The Ottawa police say it was not a hate crime, as the person who tried to burn down a hospital due to their extreme hatred of Jews wasn't antisemitic, they just have a few reasonable concerns about the war in Gaza.

What the fuck? Are those cops out of their god damned minds? I'm sorry, but this was an attempted terrorist attack targeting a hospital, and the perpetrators literally left graffiti saying they were motivated by bigotry against Jews. I'm not a detective, but I think this might be a hate crime...

Edit: Also gotta love Justin Trudeau giving a statement that reeks of ""all lives matter."" Hate crimes against Jews are skyrocketing around the world, and ole Justin condemns both Antisemitism and Islamophobia. I'm sorry, but what does Islamophobia have to do with this story? Antisemites tried to set a hospital on fire. Islamophobia plays zero role in this story. Its like Trudeau is unwilling to just outright condemn antisemitism in no uncertain terms. As I said, this is some ""All Lives Matter"" type of bullshit.",2023-11-10T21:14:09,Nice-Ascot-Bro,65,Comment,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/ottawa-general-hospital-gasoline-antisemitism-1.7025224

Far too many have suffered these past weeks, we want to do everything possible to prevent harm to them and to maximize the assistance that gets to them.”“To that end, we’ll be continuing to discuss with Israel the concrete steps to be taken to advance these objectives,” Blinken added.""

2. Also the Iron Dome. The IDF tends to avoid striking rocket sites in Gaza unlike Lebanon on the basis of proportionality. And the big reason for this proportionality is that the aid reduces iron dome being overwhelmed or shortage.

Comment,"He was VP when Obama set Syria a ""red-line"" over use of chemical weapons and then did nothing when chemical weapons were used.  He was VP when Putin invaded Crimea and the only response was a few basic sanctions. Obama also whispered to then Russian President Medvedev that he was open to a deal if the Russians would play ball until after the 2012 election. Actual Russian collusion. The Iran nuclear deal. Reports state that Iran tried to delay the Hamas attack until they got their $6bn from the US. Google this guy:

Israel took the time to investigate and verify that it was absolutely not responsible, but by the time they managed to assemble and verify the evidence, it no longer mattered. The media published small apologies in the last page that no one saw, and for the majority of the world the narrative was already set that Israel bombed a hospital. This is just one example of many.

""The Associated Press said it, too, had no advance knowledge of the attack. But it said in a statement that it was no longer working with Mr. Eslaiah, who filed the earliest and most extensive photos of the attack.  
  
**There were other red flags about Mr. Eslaiah. He posed for a picture being kissed by Yahya Sinwar, a Hamas leader who masterminded the attack.** Amit Segal, an Israeli journalist, posted video on X, formerly known as Twitter, that he claimed showed Mr. Eslaiah riding in Israel on a motorcycle while carrying a hand grenade.  
  
Mr. Eslaiah confirmed in an interview that he had been given a ride back to Gaza from Israel but said he was not the person carrying the grenade. He said he had no advance knowledge of the attack and had no links to Hamas, despite the photo with Mr. Sinwar. “I am very worried and scared,” he said.  
**Mr. Eslaiah suggested there was a double standard, noting that Israeli journalists had accompanied the Israel Defense Forces into Gaza to cover their ground operation. “Why are we not allowed, and they are allowed?” he said.**  
In a statement, CNN, which has also employed Mr. Eslaiah, sai**d, “While we have not at this time found reason to doubt the journalistic accuracy of the work he has done for us, we have decided to suspend all ties with him.”**

That sounds pretty sketchy and suspicious if you ask me. That he can't understand why a Hamas attack targeting civilians and having reporters around isn't different than IDF targeting terrorists, that's a red flag. As is the picture of him with Yahya Sinar, showing they do have some relationship. CNN cutting ties with him, doesn't paint an innocent picture here. 

Considering they arrived so soon after the Hamas attack it seems hard to argue they didn't know ahead of time. How did he get to Israel, and he needed a ride back from Hamas?

And no, it's not a privilege, it's very risky to join the army when even during peaceful times there are high chances of being raped and it will be swept under the rug. The solution is getting rid off conscription, not throwing women to the wolves.

As for vulnerability I mean something similar: during wars and even during evacuations and receiving aid, women and children are often sexually assaulted or kidnapped for trafficking. Sometimes by their own countrymen. So traveling and moving to safer places is much riskier when you are not an adult man. Just look at how most refugees, especially the ones who arrive in Europe, are male.

Comment,"I used to think this way growing up, but a trip to France and their military museum and Paris really changed my perspective about this.

France suffered a significant number of casualties, but was even more devastated when it came to percentage of their population. Of the over 7 million that they mobilized, almost 1.4 million died and 4.2 million were injured. This left them at a population disparity when WWII came calling. 

Then when WWII came about, their military officers were entrenched with “the old ways” WWI was fought. They dug static fortifications, split up assets like armor instead of grouping them together in companies of their own, and spread out across lines… Younger officers resisted these plans, but were over-ruled. The soldiers themselves still fought hard, it’s just the leadership failed them.",2023-11-10T19:44:46,Epcplayer,63,Comment,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-67356581

Comment,"
If you sacrifice 25 of your own men and vehicles trying to take out 4 terrorists that always hide in dense crowds while going out of your way to avoid hitting any civilians leaving you and your men exposed as those terrorists fire through the innocents and will blame you for their deaths anyways, how do you think that would play out on a large scale? Does that sound winnable? Does that sound reasonable or even remotely intelligent? It shouldnt.

Do you know what a Pyrric victory is?

Did you ever serve in the military and fight against terrorists groups like Hamas, Taliban, ISIS? No? Go try it. You'll find its not so easy getting a clear shot on a disguised target through a crowd of people which they specifically use as human shields and while you have to maneuver and wait for an opening to avoid hitting civilians(who very well could have hostiles among them) the terrorists have absolutely no qualms about firing at you and your squad THROUGH THE CROWD of civilians then blaming you for the carnage. Try avoiding the hail of bullets while waiting for a window that may never come or may come too late as your men lay dying around you as they took incoming fire while waiting for a clear shot.

Remember to Hamas death is glory and the civilians who die being their unwitting meat shields will go to paradise as martyrs. Yes that is exactly how Hamas thinks and operates. Same for most middle-eastern terrorist organizations. 

They cannot and do not fight using conventional warfare means because they lack the training, numbers, equipment and political leverage to do so. So they fight using underhanded and outright monstrous tactics to achieve their goals which is to cause as much death and destruction as possible and then lay the blame at Israels feet while taking as many people out with them as they can. Their goals are to ruin Israel and their western allies, break and strain allegiances and to undermine any aid Israel recieves from their allies. 

They arent trying to win a war of attrition, they are trying to win a war of propaganda and theres plenty of useful idiots around the globe they can manipulate using their sympathy and ignorance on the matter to mislead them.

In the end you dont actually care about any of that, people like you ignore nuances and context completely in favor of outrage and bias. You dont have a solution because you dont even understand the problem(you think you do but you dont). You just feel strongly but dont have any actual experience or knowledge on the matter.

Israel dropped leaflets telling civilians when and where to flee too, know why? Because Hamas is literally going out of their way to kill any who try to flee. Does that come into your equation? Israel is working with US special forces to locate and extract hostages, did you know that?Israel made sure Palestinians heard the alert to clear out of targeted regions well before the attacks started too, did you know any of that? Did you know Hamas runs Palatines government and can skew numbers coming out of their gov branches? Did you know Al Jazeera is owned by Qatar which has close ties to Iran, Hezbollah, Syria and Hamas? 

Did you know Hamas built their bases of operation and weapon storage facilities literally inside and under public places like schools, hospitals and refugee camps deliberately to force Israel to either not attack or to attack and be condemed for it? Do you even care at all about any of that? Probably not because those are details and nuances that dont fit nice and cozy with your prefered preconceived belief of ""Israel bad uncaring monsters, its that simple"".",2023-11-10T18:34:33,PeregrinePacifica,34,Comment,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-67356581

How the fuck anyone can be expected to navigate that minefield cleanly I don't know. 
It's absolutely impossible for Israel to take any action in those circumstances without inflicting huge collateral, but it's also ridiculous to expect them to not take any action at all. 

Many people, particularly in the West, just pick a side like they are supporting a sports team and defend their side.religioisly (the irony) whilst looking for any reason to attack their ""rival"""".  No matter what action they take, Israel will get slaughtered by a large section of the West. The issue with this and hyperbolic outbursts from the left is it detracts and deflects away from genuine criticism that can be levied against Israel's strategy and actions. When most of their critics are making factually, demonstrably untrue, hyperbolic claims using terms like genocide, carpet bombing, and even war crimes when 99% of the time it's used.incorrextly by people who don't actually understand what constitutes a war crime, it's easy for Israel to just shrug of any and all criticism as the ravings of fanatics.",2023-11-10T20:12:52,Choice_Valuable998,19,Comment,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-67356581

So does that mean that when Taliban were spotted in a village amongst civilians, the US Airforce would bomb the town into a pile of rubble and kill everyone?

Comment,"For started not create a system of apartheid that breeds extremism. Second would be not to unleash the most severe bombing campaign in decades if your message is that you ""care about civilian life"". Bombing is literally the most indiscriminate means of attack possible... More importantly if you specifically want Israel to curry public favor, they should explain their political horizon for this conflict. The mission statement of ""destroying Hamas"" isn't a robust enough plan to give people hope for a moral future afterwards. This is why people are asking what Israel's actual end game is because ""destroying Hamas"" and then packing it up and going home won't solve literally anything that lead to the oct 7th attack, and it's especially difficult for people to believe Israel has noble intentions for Palestinians when their history shows very much the contrary for 70+ years. Unless of course people genuinely believe these extremists spawned out of thin air one day and just decided to be evil like a cartoon villain and that nothing could have possibly prevented this outcome, Israel needs to change.

Desperation and oppression breeds violent extremism. Violent extremism is the problem Israel is dealing with. Maybe if they take actual measured steps to end the desperation and oppression of Palestinians, they can end the breeding of extremist resistance groups. Right now, admittedly, there is no good perfect altruistic solution because they have stepped on the wasp nest too much already. Hopefully though they can act with some temperance and change for the better going forwards because if people just want a return to the status quo you're basically asking for never-ending bloodshed.

Comment,"I’m sorry but this propaganda narrative which makes Hamas somehow the sole enemy of Palestinians is total bullshit. It entirely absolves the Israeli government of any responsibility for their behaviour, and it displays a total ignorance of the history of the conflict. 

Yes, Hamas are terrorists and their attack the other week was horrific, condemnable, and unjustifiable. However, it’s the latest in a long chain of violence. The massive death toll over the decades has not purely been caused by Hamas. The killing and displacement of Palestinians has been going on for a century - Hamas didn’t exist until the 1980s. 

Do you think if Hamas disappeared then suddenly the conflict would be over? By magic? What about the West Bank settlements and killings, or the apartheid conditions in Israel itself? Are they Hamas’ fault? What about the civilians, journalists and international charity workers killed by the IDF for sport on the Gaza border over the years? 

Hamas have not killed all those people in Gaza no matter how hard you try to spin it - there has been a clearly indiscriminate, disproportionate, borderline genocidal response from the Israeli government, which has been backed up by extreme right wing rhetoric and the language of ethnic cleansing by their senior ministers.",2023-11-11T04:00:51,CozzyOneStop,-1,Comment,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-67356581

Comment,"They are already doing targeted strikes, and special ops are just going to die. This is pretty much as limited as you can get while still trying to take out Hamas. 

If they pull back and just do airstrikes as best they can without any greater goal it just becomes punitive and that's much worse. 

We're starting to see signs of open rejection of Hamas, which was unheard of before the war. There is a real chance that the end of Hamas could lead to an actual chance for peace.",2023-11-10T20:35:13,HandofWinter,6,Comment,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-67356581

Nobody said anything about ""looking weak."" This is just you and the rest of the brigade drawing opinions out of a hat and saying to yourself ""Ah yes, this must be what they're *really* thinking!""

For people who supposedly hate war, oppression, and the suffering of innocents so much you sure do your best to excuse and cheerlead those most willing to commit violence to make sure those things remain in place. Because violence is wrong, so let's just let those willing to commit violence do so without resisting.

All that said I never felt like I had the temperament to be a serviceman. 

I grew up believing that to truly respect something you must to seek to and understand it. For me that was warfare throughout history and right up to the present. Of course there's only so much you can truly understand second hand and having never served.

Regarding Israel, it is not a perfect state, and the actions in the West Bank are concerning. However, it is important to note that they are not solely responsible for the suffering of the Palestinians. Germany has contributed by funding water pipes, but issues arise when these resources are misused. For example, Israel provides drinking water to Palestinians, but Hamas has disrupted this by using water pipes as rockets.

Efforts to normalize life in Israel, such as bringing in working migrants, have faced challenges due to terrorist attacks initiated by Hamas. The West has provided aid to Gaza, but the misuse of resources, like respirators and concrete, exacerbates the situation.

Comment,"There’s a unique problem happening right now. Hamas has sited their operational centers in underground bunkers beneath civilian infrastructure. They fire rockets from hospital grounds. They transport supplies in ambulances. They disguise soldiers as compassionate aid volunteers. 

That’s a very old tactic, and it’s been against international laws of warfare for (literally) centuries. Nations don’t want their own civilian population and civilian infrastructure targeted, so they agree not to target other nations’ civilians and also to make it clear which targets are civilian and which are military. 

Hamas has deliberately turned that principle on its head. Hamas is not only *deliberately* putting its military assets in civilian infrastructure, but actively disguising military assets as civilian and preventing civilians from leaving areas where permanent military assets are located. 

In combination with the October 7 attack, which deliberately targeted civilians in Israel, that leaves Israel in a situation where there are two choices, and both of them are at least tragic and might even be considered evil.  
1. Fail to act against Hamas, leaving the assets they used for this attack intact, and virtually ensuring that more October 7s will happen. 
2. Act against Hamas, inevitably killing the civilians Hamas is very deliberately using as shields. 

I am not precisely interested in defending the actions of Israel’s government. I described both those choices as evil and I mean that.

Comment,"What's this nonsense with the FFL I see everywhere? lmao. France doesn't ""send the FFL"". There is no such thing in French doctrine. When there is a war, it deploys various GTIAs (mixed battlegroups formed from drawing troops from multiple regiments themselves from totally different corps/divisions). The FFL is just a regular corps of the French army that barely represents 7% of it. Add the Air Force and Navy to that and the FFL represents an even tinier percentage of the French armed forces in general. The French military itself isn't that big as France has an all-volunteer military and doesn't have conscription/draft. The FFL is part of the conventional forces, not some upper dupper special unit like some seem to think. It is mostly an infantry force (an elite one yes, but not even the only of its kind within the French military). It can't do much on its own because it is too small. It hasn't fought any war other corps such as the Troupes de Marine (the actual backbone of French expeditionary forces), Chasseurs and other combat-oriented non-FFL troops haven't also fought in. Legionnaires are always a minority within the GTIA France deploys to war theaters because of that.

The Troupes de Marine (TDM) and FFL are pretty similar in purpose, which is why they have a rivalry. The difference is that the TDM corps is much larger and obviously only opened to French citizens. The FFL is the only thing in the entire French military opened to foreigners (around 75% of legionnaires are foreigners).",2023-11-11T09:29:38,Okiro_Benihime,3,Comment,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-67356581

Comment,">Targeted strikes with what?

You know, the US had this idea a while back. 

Take a missile, take out the explosives, and then strap a bunch of swords on it. They call it the Hellfire R9X missile. 

Remember the Jabalya refugee camp airstrike, where IDF was targeting a Hamas commander, and ended up killing a whole lot of civilians? Imagine Israel used a kinetic energy weapon instead of an explosive area weapon. Or even, a DIME (Dense Inert Metal Explosive) weapon, instead of a 2000lb bomb? 

Now, I can't tell if those options would have achieved the desired objective, because I am no privy to Israeli or US intelligence. But I haven't seen either of those weapon types being used during this conflict, for some reason, despite those weapons having been designed specifically for this type of warfare, in similar conditions, specifically to reduce collateral damage and civilian casualties, while still achieving the desired military objective.

If you think Israeli options are limited to just ""bombs and bullets"" like you put it, you are mistaken. They just choose to use only those two, for whatever reason, despite there being other options. Many, many options. Military technology has come pretty far since conflicts like the US civil war or such, where the option pretty much were just bombs or bullets. Now we have things like drones, kinetic energy missiles, hell, the Soviets deployed an orbital weapons platform on low earth orbit decades ago (Fractional Orbital Bombardment System).

Comment,">You know better than the chair of urban warfare studies at West Point, a former infantryman for 25 years, and codirector of West Point's Urban Warfare Project, right?

The specific instance discussed in the article is the attack on the Jabalya refugee camp. In that case he doesn't go so far to say it wasn't clearly within the rules of proportionality rather that it's arguable.

""But proportionality is actually a requirement to take into account how much civilian harm is anticipated in comparison to the expected concrete and direct military advantage, according to UN protocols. In other words, a high civilian death count in Jabalya could potentially be considered legal under international law so long as the military objective is of high value. The Israel Defense Forces said the intended target in this case was the senior Hamas commander who oversaw all military operations in the northern Gaza; neutralizing him is an objective that most likely clears the proportional bar.""

I also wonder about the reference to Article 51 of the UN Charter;

"" Though Gaza’s legal status is unresolved under international law, Israel needs no permission to enter the territory and resort to using force in order to wage defensive operations because Israel’s right to immediate and unilateral self-defense in accordance with Article 51 of the UN Charter is universally recognized.""

""Article 51
Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security. Measures taken by Members in the exercise of this right of self-defence shall be immediately reported to the Security Council and shall not in any way affect the authority and responsibility of the Security Council under the present Charter to take at any time such action as it deems necessary in order to maintain or restore international peace and security.""

https://www.un.org/en/about-us/un-charter/full-text#:~:text=Article%2051,maintain%20international%20peace%20and%20security.

The Security Council has in fact tried to take action as in the first sentence of Article 51. One resolution calling for a ceasefire was vetoed by the US. 
https://news.un.org/en/story/2023/10/1142507

Another put forward by the  US calling for a humanitarian pause.
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/26/two-more-resolutions-to-end-gaza-violence-fail-at-un-security-council

The common link between the resolutions has less to do with the conduct of Israeli forces but rather the ongoing humanitarian crisis caused by the press of displaced civilians in Gaza.

Because either way evidence would be generated.

If it was voluntary we would see videos and statements from people proudly going to their certain martyrdom (since Israel will bomb them anyway.) If it was compulsory we would see a lot of complaints about how Hamas forces people to put themselves below Israeli bombs.

If that were true, Israel wouldn't be dropping more bombs on Gaza in a month than the US did in Afghanistan in a whole year. Keep in mind the size of Gaza is about the size of San Marino, and Afghanistan is about the size of Saudi Arabia.

> At times of war, like this one, Israel does hit these (which is acceptable by the international law - even if civilians die, as long as it is proportianate)

No special forces are special enough to be bomb and bullet proof. Gaza will be much harder to conquer than empty towns in eastern Ukraine.

I’m sure the money made it easier for Hamas to buy weapons and rockets considering thanks to the money they received they had to pay less for humanitarian assistance but it’s a case of either “Israel is funding Hamas” or “Israel is starving Gaza of humanitarian aid” and because Israel is the moral player here they prefer to give humanitarian aid rather than be stopping any and all humanitarian aid.",2023-11-11T03:30:58,Throwaway836478,5,Comment,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-67356581

Comment,"That's paywalled, so a quick summary:

Not that much, but yes they do.  For example:

""Yet at the same time, Palestinians acknowledge making payments to the families of suicide bombers and people convicted of heinous attacks. Hakim Awad — the then-18-year-old militant mentioned by Netanyahu who murdered five family members in a West Bank settlement — receives about $14,000 a year. But because payments increase with the length of incarceration, Awad would be paid more than $1.9 million if he lived to 80, the male life expectancy in Israel.""

""The World Bank said in a 2007 report that the martyrs fund did “not seem justified from a welfare or fiscal perspective,” that the prisoners fund was “the most generous PA program” and that the combined programs benefited a relatively small number of families. At the time, the payments amounted to 1.3 percent of gross domestic product of the West Bank and Gaza, but they have grown to 2.5 percent of GDP while providing benefits to just 1 to 2 percent of the population.""",2023-11-10T23:22:59,JaronK,56,Comment,https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20231110-france-expels-palestinian-activist-to-egypt

“Ill Wind

It's the largest oil spill in history: a crashed supertanker in San Francisco Bay. Desperate to avert environmental damage—and a PR disaster—the multinational oil company releases an untested ""designer microbe"" to break up the spill.

An ""oil-eating"" microbe, designed to consume anything made of petrocarbons: oil, gasoline, synthetic fabrics, and of course plastic.

What the company doesn't realize is that their microbe propagates through the air. But when every car in the Bay Area turns up with an empty gas tank, they begin to suspect something is terribly wrong.

And when, in just a few days, every piece of plastic in the world has dissolved, it's too late...”

UK Prepares to Hike Wind Farm Prices for Struggling Developers,,2023-11-10T14:58:32,SKAOG,50,3,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-09/uk-prepares-to-hike-wind-farm-prices-for-struggling-developers
Comment,"Article's Content:  
  
The UK government is preparing to offer significantly higher subsidies for new offshore wind farms to get the country’s clean-power strategy back on track after developers shunned a previous auction.  
  
The ceiling for bids from offshore wind companies in the next auction round is likely to be considerably more than this year’s £44 ($54) of guaranteed revenue per megawatt-hour of power produced, according to people familiar with the matter. The price, due to be published later this month, is likely to be set at about £70-75, one of the people said. Shares of wind-farm developers including SSE Plc and RWE AG rose on the news.  
  
Orsted A/S, the world’s largest offshore wind builder, closed up 5.3% in Copenhagen, its largest jump in a week.  
  
A substantial hike may help attract developers — none of which bid into the latest auction round because the price was too low for offshore wind to be viable. It would also come as Orsted plans to decide by December whether to proceed with a UK development, and as Sweden’s Vattenfall AB mulls what to do with a giant project off the English coast that it shelved earlier this year in response to soaring costs.  
  
An auction limit of £75 a megawatt-hour will mark a reversal from previous tenders, where prices have fallen steadily in recent years and some deals hit a record-low £37 in 2022. The prices are based to 2012 levels, meaning the resulting contracts may be more expensive.  
  
“I don’t see why at £75 you shouldn’t be able to build out offshore,” said Henrik Andersen, the chief executive officer of turbine-maker Vestas Wind Systems A/S, in an interview Thursday. “Right now you see it in the UK there is an inflationary development and that still triggers some price development upwards.”  
  
Britain’s Contracts for Difference program ensures wind developers receive a fixed price for each megawatt-hour of power their turbines produce, usually on 15-year contracts that lock in revenue certainty, funded by consumer bills. It’s been a key pillar to secure clean-energy investment in the UK, which is targeting 50 gigawatts of offshore wind capacity by 2030, up from about 14 gigawatts now.  
  
While higher subsidies in the next auction round, known as AR6, may well reinvigorate offshore wind development, it will likely feed through to increased electricity costs for consumers still burdened with sky-high bills in the wake of last year’s energy crisis.  
  
Energy Secretary Claire Coutinho said last month that her department was prepared to hike the price. “I am committed to a successful AR6, a round that includes offshore wind in which sustainably-priced projects will be able to compete,” she said in a speech.  
  
It’s not just the cost of building renewables that’s rising. The capacity market, which helps secure investment in gas-fired power plants among other assets, saw prices soar in the last auction to levels far higher than expected.",2023-11-10T14:59:01,SKAOG,3,Comment,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-09/uk-prepares-to-hike-wind-farm-prices-for-struggling-developers
Comment,"An investigation into recent whale deaths in the Atlantic has found that the noise produced by offshore wind sonar activities is much louder than NOAA Fisheries’ National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) has reported. Consequently, the setback distances adopted by NMFS to protect ocean life from the noise are too short and place whales and other marine mammals at a high risk of encountering harmful levels.
